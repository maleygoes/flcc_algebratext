<h1 id="foundations-of-arithmetic">Foundations of Arithmetic</h1>
<h2 id="OrderofOperations">Order of Operations</h2>
<p>When you need to follow a set of instructions, it’s pretty important
that the instructions be clear. Suppose, for example, you’ve just filled
a prescription, and instructions on the bottle say “A dose is two
capsules. Take two each day.”</p>
<p>So ... are you supposed to take two capsules (one dose) each day? Or
are you supposed to take two doses (four capsules) each day?</p>
<p>Directions like this simply are not very good directions. Two
different people interpreting these instructions differently will take
different amounts of the medicine, and at least one of those amounts is
going to be wrong. This is obviously not a good thing. The expressions
we right down in mathematics are also sets of instructions. For example,
the expression:</p>
<p><span class="math display">7 + 1 − 3 * 2</span></p>
<p>is a set of instructions telling you to perform a collection of
arithmetic steps. There should not be any room for misinterpretation
about just what those instructions are telling us to do. Two different
people trying to follow these instructions should always get the same
results.</p>
<p>There’s not really any ambiguity about what numbers we are supposed
to use or what arithmetic operations we are supposed to do with those
numbers. “7” means seven, “+” means addition, and so on. But there is
room for disagreement about the order in which we should do those steps,
and different people following different orders will get different
results. So, to avoid any possible confusion, we adopt a set of rules
known as the order of operations:</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><strong><u>Order of Operations</u></strong><br />
</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align: left;">Operations</th>
<th style="text-align: left;">What to Do</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Parenthesis</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Any operations inside of parentheses must
be done before any operations outside of parentheses. What is inside of
the parentheses takes priority over every other operation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Exponents</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Exponents are evaluated before any other
operation</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Multiplication and Division</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Multiplications and divisions are done
next. If there is more than one to do, work from left to right.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: left;">Addition and Subtraction</td>
<td style="text-align: left;">Lastly do additions and subtractions. If
there is more than one to do, work from left to right.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<p>The order can be remembered using the acronym <strong>PEMDAS</strong>
(for <strong><u>P</u></strong>arentheses,
<strong><u>E</u></strong>xponents,
<strong><u>M</u></strong>ultiplication and
<strong><u>D</u></strong>ivision, <strong><u>A</u></strong>ddition and
<strong><u>S</u></strong>ubtraction).</p>
<p>Given this order, there is never any room for misunderstanding
arithmetic instructions. The steps of:</p>
<p><span class="math display">7 + 1 − 3 * 2</span></p>
<p>must be done following the order of operations.</p>
<p>There are no parentheses or exponents in this expression, so we skip
over those steps and move next to multiplication and division. We have
one multiplication in the expression, so we multiply <span
class="math inline">3 * 2</span> to get <span
class="math inline">6</span>, and arrive at:</p>
<p><span
class="math display">7 + 1 − <strong>3</strong> <strong>*</strong> <strong>2</strong> = 7 + 1 − 6</span></p>
<p>The next step is additions and subtractions, and we have one of each.
Order of operations says we do them from left to right, so we first add
<span class="math inline">7 + 1</span> to get <span
class="math inline">8</span>:</p>
<p><span
class="math display"><strong>7</strong> <strong>+</strong> <strong>1</strong> − 6 = 8 − 6</span></p>
<p>and then finish up by subtracting <span
class="math inline">8 − 6</span> to arrive at a final result:</p>
<p><span class="math display"><strong>2</strong></span></p>
<p>A few examples will further illustrate.</p>
<div id="OrderofOperationsExample1" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 1.1</strong>. <strong>Evaluate <span
class="math inline">4 − 2<sup>3</sup> + 7(2 − 3)</span></strong></p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span> Following order of operations we
will (a) do what is inside parentheses, then (b) apply the exponent,
then (c) multiply, and then (d) add and subtract, left to right:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}
			5-2^3+7\bm{(2-3)} &amp; = 5-\bm{2^3}+7(-1)\\
						&amp; = 5-8+\bm{7(-1)} \\
						&amp; = \bm{5-8}-7 \\
						&amp; = \bm{-3-7} \\
						&amp; = \bm{-10}
	
\end{aligned}$$</span></p>
</div>
<div id="OrderofOperationsExample2" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 1.2</strong>. <strong>Evaluate <span
class="math inline">(5 − 2)<sup>3</sup> + 7(2) − 3</span></strong></p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>We again follow order of
operations:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}
		\bm{(5-2)}^3+7(2)-3 &amp; = \bm{(3)^3}+7(2)-3\\
			&amp; = 27+\bm{7(2)}-3 \\
			&amp; = \bm{27+14}-3 \\
			&amp; = \bm{41-3} \\
			&amp; = \bm{38}
	
\end{aligned}$$</span></p>
</div>
<p>You may wonder why the order of operations is what it is. Why put
multiplication before addition, or division after exponents? Why the
PEMDAS order instead of some other? In fact, there is no absolute reason
why order of operations <em>has</em> to be the way it is, but it is
important to have a commonly accepted standard to avoid
misunderstandings. The PEMDAS order of operations is sort of like the
rule that we drive on the right side of the road in the US. There really
is no reason why driving on the right is better than driving on the
left, and it doesn’t really matter all that much which side we agree is
the correct one, but it is pretty important that we all agree which side
we’re all going to drive on! PEMDAS is the accepted “rules of the road”
in mathematics. <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="common-pitfalls">Common Pitfalls</h3>
<p>Most of the time, evaluating an expression following order of
operations is straightforward. Follow the PEMDAS order, just like we did
in the examples above, and everything’s fine. There are, though, a few
situations where things can get a little confusing.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered"
id="multiplication-and-division-are-tied-as-are-addition-and-substraction">Multiplication
and Division are tied as are Addition and Substraction</h4>
<p>One situation we’ve already encountered, but it bears repetition.
Remember that even though M comes before D in PEMDAS, Multiplication and
Division are tied and are carried out from left to right as at the same
time. Similarly Addition and Subtraction are tied and carried out from
left to right in the order they appear.</p>
<div id="OrderofOperationsExample3" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 1.3</strong>. <strong>Evaluate <span
class="math inline">20 ÷ 4 * 3</span></strong></p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span> We carry out the division and then
the multiplication since this is how they appear from left to right in
the expression:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}
			\bm{20 \div 4} * 3 &amp; = \bm{5*3}\\
			&amp; = \bm{15}
	
\end{aligned}$$</span></p>
</div>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="nested-parentheses">Nested Parentheses</h4>
<p>Parentheses can occur inside other parentheses, called nested
parentheses. Following order of operations, we do whatever is inside
parentheses first. If what is inside those parentheses has multiple
steps, we need to do those steps following order of operations, and so
we work on the parentheses inside first. The following example
illustrates:</p>
<div id="OrderofOperationsExample4" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 1.4</strong>. <strong>Evaluate <span
class="math inline">4 − 2[7 − 3(4 + 2)<sup>2</sup>]</span></strong></p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span> Recall that the different shapes [ ]
and ( ) for the parentheses have no significance; the different shapes
are just used to make the expression easier to read.</p>
<p>Looking at the expression overall, we need to do what is inside the [
] parentheses first. Once inside those parentheses, what do we do first?
We do what is inside the ( ) parentheses of course!</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}
		4-2[7-3\bm{(4+2)}^2] &amp; = 4-2[7-3\bm{(6)^2}]\\
		&amp; = 4-2[7\bm{-3(36)}] \\
		&amp; = 4-2\bm{[7-108]} \\
		&amp; = 4\bm{-2[-101]} \\
		&amp; = \bm{4+202} \\
		&amp; = \bm{206}
	
\end{aligned}$$</span></p>
</div>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="exponents-and-negative-numbers">Exponents and
Negative Numbers</h4>
<p>A second situation often gives more trouble. Suppose we want to
evaluate:</p>
<p><span class="math display">−3<sup>2</sup></span></p>
<p>There are two reasonable ways to read this. Does the exponent apply
just to the <span class="math inline">3</span>, or does is apply to the
entire <span class="math inline">−3</span>? In other words, does this
mean <span class="math inline">(−3)(−3)</span>, or should we read it as
<span class="math inline">−(3)(3)</span>?</p>
<p>The correct answer is the second one. The correct evaluation is:</p>
<p><span
class="math display">−<strong>3</strong><sup><strong>2</strong></sup> = −<strong>(</strong><strong>3</strong><strong>)</strong><strong>(</strong><strong>3</strong><strong>)</strong> = <strong>−</strong><strong>9</strong></span></p>
<p>Why do we interpret things this way? By convention, we interpret
<span class="math inline">−3</span> as though the negative sign and the
<span class="math inline">3</span> are being multiplied. In other words,
we treat <span class="math inline">−3</span> as though it were <span
class="math inline">(−1)(3)</span>. And so, following this convention,
since exponents come before multiplication:</p>
<p><span
class="math display">−<strong>3</strong><sup><strong>2</strong></sup> = (−1)<strong>3</strong><sup><strong>2</strong></sup> = <strong>(</strong><strong>−</strong><strong>1</strong><strong>)</strong><strong>(</strong><strong>9</strong><strong>)</strong> = <strong>−</strong><strong>9</strong></span></p>
<p>If we actually wanted to say <span
class="math inline">(−3)(−3)</span> we would need to use parentheses and
write <span class="math inline">(−3)<sup>2</sup></span>. Since
parentheses take precedence over everything, the correct evaluation of
that would be:</p>
<p><span
class="math display"><strong>(</strong><strong>−</strong><strong>3</strong><strong>)</strong><sup><strong>2</strong></sup> = <strong>(</strong><strong>−</strong><strong>3</strong><strong>)</strong><strong>(</strong><strong>−</strong><strong>3</strong><strong>)</strong> = <strong>9</strong></span></p>
<div id="OrderofOperationsExample5" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 1.5</strong>. <strong>Evaluate <span
class="math inline">−5<sup>2</sup> + (−3)<sup>2</sup> − (−4<sup>2</sup>)</span></strong></p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span> Using the discussion above on
exponents and signs:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}
	-\bm{5^2}+\bm{(-3)^2}-(-\bm{4^2}) &amp; = -25+9 \bm{-(-16)}\\
		&amp; = \bm{-25+9+16} \\
		&amp; = \bm{0}
\end{aligned}$$</span></p>
</div>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="implied-groupings">Implied Groupings</h4>
<p>The third special situation to look out for is best illustrated with
an example first.</p>
<div id="OrderofOperationsExample6" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 1.6</strong>. <strong>Evaluate <span
class="math inline">$\displaystyle
\frac{30-16}{4+3}$</span></strong></p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>We evaluate the numerator and
denominator before carrying out the division</p>
<p><span
class="math display">$$\frac{30-16}{4+3}=\frac{14}{7}=2$$</span></p>
</div>
<p>No problem, right?</p>
<p>There’s only one tiny little issue with this example. Order of
operations says multiplications and divisions have to be done before
additions and subtractions. But in this example, we did just the
opposite – we did the addition and subtraction before we did the
division! So, even though it should feel as though we did do this
correctly, it also looks like we violated order of operations, which
would not be correct.</p>
<p>But now if we go back and try to follow the rules, we run into a
roadblock. Clearly we are supposed to divide the top, <span
class="math inline">30 − 16</span>, by the bottom, <span
class="math inline">4 + 3</span>. But how can we possibly do that
without first subtracting <span class="math inline">30 − 16</span> to
get <span class="math inline">14</span>, and adding <span
class="math inline">4 + 3</span> to get <span
class="math inline">7</span>? We can’t!</p>
<p>What we have here is an example of an implied grouping. Because we
cannot possibly do the division first, we know the numerator and
denominator must be meant to be treated as though they were grouped by
parentheses. So, when we see:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$\frac{30-16}{4+3}$$</span></p>
<p>we mentally interpret that as though there were parentheses
there:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$\frac{(30-16)}{(4+3)}$$</span></p>
<p>We don’t usually actually write them, because it is always clear that
we have to interpret any fraction as though they were there. Since
“everyone knows” they must be there, we don’t bother writing them.</p>
<p>There are other implied groupings as well. Two examples you may have
encountered before are absolute value and square roots. PEMDAS doesn’t
say anything at all about those, but we always interpret them as though
what is inside them is in parentheses.</p>
<div id="OrderofOperationsExample7" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 1.7</strong>. <strong>Evaluate <span
class="math inline">$\displaystyle
\frac{4+|5-13|}{\sqrt{7+2}+1}$</span></strong></p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>Following order of operations, we
have:</p>
<p><span
class="math display">$$\frac{4+|5-13|}{\sqrt{7+2}+1}=\frac{4+|-8|}{\sqrt{9}+1}=\frac{4+8}{3+1}=\frac{12}{4}=3$$</span></p>
</div>
<h3 id="order-of-operation-and-your-calculator">Order of Operation and
Your Calculator</h3>
<p>Almost all calculators sold today, including the calculator you are
using for this course, have order of operations built-in. When you enter
an expression to evaluate, the calculator automatically follows order of
operations correctly. So to evaluate:</p>
<p><span
class="math display">5 + (8 − 3<sup>2</sup>)<sup>4</sup></span></p>
<p>you would enter (try it now):</p>
<p>“<span
class="math display">5 + (8 − 3<sup>∧</sup>2)<sup>∧</sup>4</span>”</p>
<p>and once you hit enter the calculator should reply with the correct
answer, <span class="math inline">6</span>.</p>
<p>This is a very, very nice feature. But, it comes with some drawbacks,
especially when dealing with the special cases discussed in the last
section.</p>
<p>Suppose you need to square the number <span
class="math inline">3</span>. You type “<span
class="math inline">3<sup>∧</sup>2</span>” into your calculator and get
the correct answer, <span class="math inline">9</span>. But now suppose
you need to square <span class="math inline">−3</span>. You type “<span
class="math inline">−3<sup>∧</sup>2</span>” into your calculator just as
you did with <span class="math inline">3</span>. But since your
calculator follows order of operations, it will interpret this according
to those rules, not according to what you meant, and the answer you get
will be <span class="math inline">−9</span>. If you want to square <span
class="math inline">−3</span>, you need to insert parentheses to tell
the calculator that is what you mean. So you need to enter: “<span
class="math inline">(−3)<sup>∧</sup>2</span>” to arrive at the correct
result.</p>
<p>Implied groupings are also an issue with the calculator as the
following example will illustrate.</p>
<div id="OrderofOperationsExample8" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 1.8</strong>. To evaluate <span
class="math inline">$\displaystyle \frac{8+10}{5-3}$</span> Jessie typed
“<span class="math inline">8 + 10/5 − 3</span>” into her calculator, and
got an answer of 7. This is not the correct answer. What went wrong and
how do we correct it?</p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span> When we as human beings see the
<span class="math inline">8 + 10</span> written as a numerator and <span
class="math inline">5 − 3</span> as the denominator, we understand that
there is an implied grouping at work. But when she typed “<span
class="math inline">8 + 10/5 − 3</span>”, the machine had no way of
knowing about that grouping, and so it followed order of operations,
dividing before adding and subtracting:</p>
<p><span
class="math display">8 + <strong>10</strong><strong>/</strong><strong>5</strong> − 3 = 8 + 2 − 3 = 10 − 3 = 7</span></p>
<p>To correct this, Jessie needs to insert those implied parentheses
into what she types into the calculator: “<span
class="math inline">(8 + 10)/(5 − 3)</span>”. The calculator will then
do what was intended:</p>
<p><span class="math display">(8 + 10)/(5 − 3) = 18/2 = 9</span></p>
</div>
<p>With long calculations, especially those with nested parentheses, it
can become tedious to enter the whole expression into the calculator at
once. In those cases, it may be easier to break the expression into
pieces (following order of operations of course) and use the calculator
to evaluate each of the pieces. The next example will illustrate.</p>
<div id="OrderofOperationsExample9" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 1.9</strong>. <strong>Evaluate <span
class="math inline">$\displaystyle
\frac{-5+2(3-1)^2}{7+4(3^2-5)}$</span></strong></p>

<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span> To enter this into the calculator
all at once, you would need to insert the implied parentheses, and then
enter: “<span
class="math inline">(−5 + 2(3 − 1)<sup>∧</sup>2)/(7 + 4(3<sup>∧</sup>2 − 5))</span>”.</p>
<p>That works, but it is such a long entry that it would be easy to make
a typo entering it, and hard to notice that it happened. It might be
better to evaluate the numerator and denominator separately, and then
divide the results:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}
		&amp; -5+2(3-1) ^\wedge 2 = 3 \\
		&amp; 7+4(3 ^\wedge 2-5) = 23
	
\end{aligned}$$</span></p>
<p>The final answer then is <span class="math inline">3/23</span>.
Dividing this and rounding to 4 decimal places gives a final answer of
<span class="math inline">0.1304</span>.</p>
<p>There is another advantage to doing the top and bottom separately.
<span class="math inline">3/23</span> does not divide evenly, and so you
might want to leave it just as a fraction. Doing the two pieces
separately makes it easy to see that the answer can be written as <span
class="math inline">3/23</span>. Doing the whole thing in one piece
would just give a decimal which you’d be unlikely to recognize as the
fraction <span class="math inline">3/23</span>.</p>
<p>Sometimes rounding will raise issues depending on how you break
things up to enter into the calculator. While this may result in
different answers, those differences will be very small. In general we
won’t worry about these sorts of discrepancies.</p>

<h2 id="ArithmeticwithFractions">Arithmetic with Fractions</h2>
<p>We often encounter fractions in mathematics and in the real world.
Before moving forward in this book, we’ll take some time to review the
rules of fraction arithmetic, and also discuss using your calculators
for fractions.</p>
<h3 id="adding-and-subtracting-fractions">Adding and Subtracting
Fractions</h3>
<p>Suppose you are traveling from New York to Singapore. You have a
layover in Vancouver, where you pick up a book to read on the flight for
C$9.95 (Canadian dollars). Then, on your second layover in Tokyo you
pick up a souvenir fridge magnet for ¥2500 (Japanese yen). How much have
you spent?</p>
<p>Obviously you can’t just add 9.95 + 2500 to answer this question.
Canadian dollars and Japanese yen are different currencies, and so you
can’t just add them together and expect to get an answer that means
anything. A sensible answer to the question requires you to put the
amounts of money in some common terms, such as converting them to US
dollars, and then adding the results.</p>
<p>The same issue arises if we need to add fractions. Halves and thirds
are different things, and so to add we first need to put these fractions
into common terms. We’ll recall the method for doing this below, and
then work through a few examples.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><strong><u>Adding and Subtracting Fractions</u></strong><br />
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Find a common denominator. A common denominator is any number
that all of the denominators divide into evenly.</p></li>
<li><p>A common denominator can always be found by multiplying all the
denominators together. Often, though, this will be larger than
necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>It is desirable, but not mandatory, to use the least common
denominator. If the denominators share any factors in common, each
factor only needs to be included in the common denominator as many times
as it is used in the denominator in which it appears the most.</p></li>
<li><p>Each fraction can be changed to the common denominator by
multiplying its numerator and denominator by whatever is needed to
change the denominator into the common denominator.</p></li>
<li><p>Once all the denominators are common, the fractions can be
added/subtracted by adding/subtracting their numerators.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Putting this in words makes it seem more complicated than it actually
is. Some examples will help remind you how this all works.</p>
<div id="ArithmeticwithFractionsExample1" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 1.10</strong>. Evaluate <span
class="math inline">$\displaystyle \frac{3}{5} +
\frac{4}{3}$</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>The denominators are <span
class="math inline">3</span> and <span class="math inline">5</span>, and
so a common denominator is <span class="math inline">3 ⋅ 5 = 15</span>.
Since <span class="math inline">3</span> and <span
class="math inline">5</span> don’t have any common factors, this is the
smallest possible common denominator.</p>
<p>To make <span class="math inline">5</span> into the common
denominator of <span class="math inline">15</span>, we need to multiply
by <span class="math inline">3</span>. So we’ll multiply the first
fraction by <span class="math inline">$\frac{3}{3}$</span> (recall that
we can do this because <span class="math inline">$\frac{3}{3} =
1$</span>, and so this changes the form of the fraction but not its
value, since we are really just multiplying by <span
class="math inline">1</span>). For similar reasons, we’ll multiply the
second fraction by <span class="math inline">$\frac{5}{5}$</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$\displaystyle \frac{3}{5} \left(
\frac{3}{3} \right) + \frac{4}{3} \left( \frac{5}{5} \right) =
\frac{9}{15} + \frac{20}{15} = \frac{29}{15}$$</span></p>
<p>Note that this answer is an <strong>improper fraction</strong>, which
means that its numerator is larger than its denominator. This answer
could be rewritten as the <strong>mixed number</strong>; <span
class="math inline">$1\frac{14}{15}$</span>. Either answer is correct.
In this book, we will not rewrite improper fractions as mixed numbers,
unless there is a clear reason to do so.</p>

<h3 id="reducing-fractions-to-lowest-terms">Reducing Fractions to Lowest
Terms</h3>
<p>There are <span class="math inline">60</span> minutes in an hour, and
so <span class="math inline">30</span> minutes is <span
class="math inline">$\frac{30}{60}$</span> of an hour. But no one would
actually say “<span class="math inline">$\frac{30}{60}$</span> of an
hour”; of course you’d say <span class="math inline">30</span> minutes
is <span class="math inline">$\frac{1}{2}$</span> of an hour. The
fractions <span class="math inline">$\frac{30}{60}$</span> and <span
class="math inline">$\frac{1}{2}$</span> are equal to each other, so
either would be technically correct, but it’s obviously much simpler to
use the fraction with the smaller numerator and denominator.</p>
<p>When we replace a fraction like <span
class="math inline">$\frac{30}{60}$</span> to an equal fraction with a
smaller numerator and denominator, we say that we
<strong>reduce</strong> it. When a fraction cannot be reduced any
further, we say it is written in <strong>lowest terms</strong>. To keep
things as simple as possible, it is a standard practice to reduce
fractions to lowest terms whenever possible.</p>
<p>A fraction can be reduced if and only if its numerator and
denominator share a common factor (other than <span
class="math inline">1</span>). For example, <span
class="math inline">$\displaystyle \frac{30}{60}$</span> can be reduced
because its numerator and denominator have common factors: <span
class="math inline">2</span>, <span class="math inline">3</span>, <span
class="math inline">5</span>, <span class="math inline">6</span>, <span
class="math inline">10</span>, <span class="math inline">15</span>, and
<span class="math inline">30</span>. Since <span
class="math inline">30</span> is the largest, we’ll use that, and
rewrite <span class="math inline">$\displaystyle \frac{30}{60}$</span>
as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$\frac{30}{60} = \frac{30 \times 1}{30
\times 2}$$</span></p>
<p>which, because of the rules for multiplying fractions, we can rewrite
as:</p>
<p><span
class="math display">$$\frac{30}{30}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)$$</span></p>
<p>and since <span class="math inline">$\displaystyle \frac{30}{30} =
1$</span>, we see that the result just is equal to <span
class="math inline">$\displaystyle \frac{1}{2}$</span>.</p>
<p>Usually we aren’t quite so formal about this; more often, we talk
about canceling a common factor which amounts to the same thing.
Following that route, once we see the common factor of <span
class="math inline">30</span> in the numerator and denominator, we
“cancel it out” like this:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$\frac{30}{60} = \frac{30 \cdot 1}{30
\cdot 2} = \frac{\cancel{30} \cdot 1}{\cancel{30} \cdot 2} =
\frac{1}{2}$$</span></p>
<p>It’s good to have some idea of why this works, but from a practical
standpoint we usually just go with this cancellation approach.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><strong><u>Method for Reducing Fractions</u></strong><br />
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If the numerator and denominator share a common factor, cancel
it.</p></li>
<li><p>If the resulting fraction’s numerator and denominator don’t share
any common factors, you’re done, the fraction has been reduced to lowest
terms. If they do have a common factor, repeat.</p></li>
</ul>

data-reference="ArithmeticwithFractionsExample4">1.13</a> were
intentionally set up so that the final answer would come out to be in
lowest terms. You cannot always assume that this will happen, though.
Whenever you do any fraction arithmetic, you should as a last step
reduce the answer to lowest terms.</p>
<div id="ArithmeticwithFractionsExample5" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 1.14</strong>. Evaluate <span
class="math inline">$\displaystyle
\frac{1}{6}+\frac{1}{3}-\frac{1}{8}$</span></p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>The least common denominator here is
<span class="math inline">24</span>. So:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$\displaystyle
\frac{1}{6}\left(\frac{4}{4}\right) +
\frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{8}{8}\right)+
\frac{1}{8}\left(\frac{3}{3}\right)=\frac{4}{24} +
\frac{8}{24}-\frac{3}{24}=\frac{9}{24}$$</span></p>
<p>Now we need to see if this fraction can be reduced to lower terms.
Since <span class="math inline">9</span> and <span
class="math inline">24</span> share a common factor <span
class="math inline">3</span> this should not be considered the final
answer yet. We still need to reduce the fraction to lowest terms.</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$\frac{9}{24}=\frac{3 \cdot 3}{3 \cdot
8}=\frac{\cancel{3} \cdot 3}{\cancel{3} \cdot
8}=\frac{3}{8}$$</span></p>
</div>
<h3 id="fraction-arithmetic-and-your-calculator">Fraction Arithmetic and
Your Calculator</h3>
<p>Your calculator can be used as a tool for fraction arithmetic.</p>
<p>On any calculator, you can evaluate arithmetic expressions involving
fractions. If you want to add <span class="math inline">$\displaystyle
\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4}$</span> you can simply enter that expression
into your calculator and get a correct result.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, most calculators will give that answer as a decimal,
not as a fraction. So, for this example you would get an answer of <span
class="math inline">0.75</span>. Now, if a decimal answer is what you
are looking for, that’s fine, but if you want it as a fraction, you’d
need to recognize that <span class="math inline">0.75</span> is <span
class="math inline">$\frac{3}{4}$</span> yourself. That’s fine for a
familiar fraction like <span class="math inline">$\frac{3}{4}$</span>,
but it wouldn’t work so well if you were evaluating <span
class="math inline">$\displaystyle \frac{2}{7} -
\frac{6}{5}\left(\frac{2}{39}\right)$</span>. You’re not likely to
recognize that your calculator’s decimal answer of <span
class="math inline">0.22417582</span> is actually <span
class="math inline">$\displaystyle \frac{306}{1365}$</span>.</p>
<p>The TI-83 and TI-84 calculators have the ability, though, to report
answers as fractions, if you tell them to.</p>
<p>On your calculator, locate the “MATH” key (it should be in the
leftmost column, third or fourth from the top). If you hit that key it
will take you to a menu, and the first item on that menu is “1: <span
class="math inline">▸</span> Frac”.</p>
<p>This command tells the calculator to express the answer as a fraction
in lowest terms. So, for example, suppose we want to add <span
class="math inline">$\displaystyle \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4}$</span> and
get the answer as a fraction, not a decimal. We would enter:</p>
<p>“<span class="math display">1/2 + 1/4 ▸ Frac</span>”</p>
<p>and then hit return to get the answer:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$\frac{3}{4}$$</span></p>
<p>We can use this with any fractional expression we want to evaluate.
Let’s revisit Example <a href="#ArithmeticwithFractionsExample5"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="ArithmeticwithFractionsExample5">1.14</a> now:</p>
<div id="ArithmeticwithFractionsExample6" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 1.15</strong>. Evaluate <span
class="math inline">$\displaystyle \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{3} -
\frac{1}{8}$</span> using your calculator.</p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>We enter:</p>
<p>“<span class="math display">1/6 + 1/3 − 1/8 ▸ Frac</span>”</p>
<p>Hit enter and then get the result:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$\frac{3}{8}$$</span></p>
</div>
<p>We can also use this feature to reduce a fraction to lowest terms.
Since the calculator always returns the result in lowest terms, if you
enter a fraction that is not, it will evaluate it as a decimal and then
convert the result to a fraction in lowest terms. The end result -
you’ve reduced your fraction.</p>
<div id="ArithmeticwithFractionsExample7" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 1.16</strong>. Reduce <span
class="math inline">$\displaystyle \frac{5544}{22,176}$</span> to lowest
terms</p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>On the calculator:</p>
<p>“<span class="math display">5544/22176 ▸ Frac</span>”</p>

<h3 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h3>
<p>With the “<span class="math inline">▸</span>Frac” feature of the
calculator available to us, we can easily handle otherwise tedious
fraction arithmetic. This is really, really good news. One word of
warning is very important here. You may get the impression that, since
the calculator can essentially do any fraction arithmetic you need, that
you don’t really need to know the rules and techniques of fraction
arithmetic. While it is true that you’ll be able to avoid a lot of this
work by effective calculator use, you will still need these rules and
techniques for algebra purposes later in the course. It is for this
reason especially that homework exercises are provided where you are
asked not to rely on the calculator for your fraction arithmetic. If you
skip the opportunity to master those skills here, you’ll have much more
trouble dealing with algebraic fractions later on!</p>

<h2 id="AlgebraicSubstitution">Algebraic Substitution</h2>
<p>A 4000 year old Babylonian tablet, now on display at the Institute
for the Study of the Ancient World at New York University, poses the
following question:</p>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>“If the cost of digging a trench is 9
gin, and the trench has a length of 5 ninda and is one-half ninda deep,
and if a worker’s daily load of earth costs 10 gin to move, and his
daily wages are 6 se of silver, then how wide is the canal?” <a
href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
</div>
<p>Except for the unfamiliar units (what the heck is a ninda or a gin or
a se?) this looks like a pretty typical algebra problem, and you might
imagine ancient Babylonian students sweating over this problem in
algebra class. You might imagine them struggling through the wording to
set up an equation, and then wrestling through the algebra to solve that
equation and get the answer. Except for one thing: algebra as we know it
wasn’t invented until thousands of years later. <a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>The methods available to Babylonian math students and their teachers
didn’t include the tools of variables and equations that we are so used
to today. They had their methods of course, but a problem like this was
vastly more difficult to solve without the tools than we now take for
granted.</p>
<p>Even though it may not always seem that way, the point of algebra is
to make problem solving simpler. We use variables, algebraic expressions
built from them, and equations using them to approach problem-solving in
a logical and organized way. In this chapter, we’ll review some of the
basic tools and methods of this approach.</p>
<h3 id="substitution-in-algebraic-expressions">Substitution in Algebraic
Expressions</h3>
<p>In algebra we use symbols as a more compact alternative to ordinary
language. For example, the fact:</p>
<div class="center">
<p>The area of a rectangle is the result of multiplying its length by
its width</p>
</div>
<p>can be expressed much more simply using mathematical symbols and
variables in place of words and as the equation:</p>
<p><span
class="math display"><em>A</em> = <em>L</em><em>W</em></span></p>
<p>Both the English sentence and the equation are saying the same thing,
but it is usually advantageous to use symbols rather than words.</p>
<p>An <strong>algebraic expression</strong> is any collection of
variables and/or numbers tied together by arithmetic operations. In the
above equation, we used the algebraic expression “LW” to represent the
instructions for calculating the area.</p>
<p>Now, suppose we have a rectangular garden that measures 20 feet by 16
feet. To calculate its area, we can use the equation above, plugging in
20 for <span class="math inline"><em>L</em></span> and 16 for <span
class="math inline"><em>W</em></span>, to get:</p>
<p><span class="math display"><em>A</em> = (20 feet)(16 feet) = 320
square feet</span></p>
<p>“Plugging in” specific values for the variables and evaluating the
result is more formally known as <strong>algebraic
substitution</strong>.</p>
<div id="AlgebraicSubstitutionExample1" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 1.17</strong>. Evaluate the algebraic expression
<span
class="math inline"><em>t</em><sup>2</sup> + 2<em>t</em> − 4<em>p</em></span>
if <span class="math inline"><em>t</em> = 7</span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>p</em> = −3</span></p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>We start with the equation, and then
replace the variables <span class="math inline"><em>t</em></span> and
<span class="math inline"><em>p</em></span> with their given values, and
then do the arithmetic:</p>
<p><span
class="math display"><em>t</em><sup>2</sup> + 2<em>t</em> − 4<em>p</em> = (7)<sup>2</sup> + 2(7) − 4(−3) = 75</span></p>
<p>Since we don’t know what this algebraic expression is meant to
represent or the appropriate units for the variables represent, we just
leave the final answer as <span class="math inline">75</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="AlgebraicSubstitutionExample2" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 1.18</strong>. Evaluate <span
class="math inline">$\frac{c^2V}{2}$</span> if <span
class="math inline"><em>c</em> = −3</span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>V</em> = 200</span></p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>The original equation contains <span
class="math inline"><em>c</em><sup>2</sup></span>, so whatever <span
class="math inline"><em>c</em></span> is, we need to square it. But if
we write <span class="math inline">−3<sup>2</sup></span>, remember that
it is only the <span class="math inline">3</span> that gets squared. To
make sure that the entire <span class="math inline">−3</span> will be
squared, we need to use parentheses:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$\frac{c^2 V}{2} = \frac{(-3)^2(200)}{2}
= \frac{9*200}{2} = \frac{1800}{2} = 900$$</span></p>
</div>
<p>The example above warns of a common and easy-to-make mistake when
substituting negative numbers. This error can always be avoided by
putting parentheses around the number. While parentheses are not always
needed, you may want to consider always putting parentheses around
negative numbers when you substitute them in, to play it safe.</p>
<div id="AlgebraicSubstitutionExample3" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 1.19</strong>. Evaluate <span
class="math inline"><em>P</em><sup>2</sup><em>T</em><sup>3</sup> − 1</span>

</div>
<h3 id="formulas">Formulas</h3>
<p>When we use an algebraic expression or an equation involving
algebraic expressions to express a specific relationship between
quantities, we usually call it a formula. In the discussion above, the
equation <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em> = <em>L</em><em>W</em></span> is the
formula for the area of a rectangle. On the other hand, we would
probably not call the algebraic expressions in Examples <a
href="#AlgebraicSubstitutionExample1" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="AlgebraicSubstitutionExample1">1.17</a>, <a
href="#AlgebraicSubstitutionExample2" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="AlgebraicSubstitutionExample2">1.18</a> and <a
href="#AlgebraicSubstitutionExample3" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="AlgebraicSubstitutionExample3">1.19</a> formulas,
because we don’t really have any sense of those expressions’ purposes or
meanings.</p>
<p>When you are just substituting into algebraic expressions without any
sense of what they represent, all you can give in a final answer is the
just numeric result. When you have know the units involved or the
meaning of what you are calculating, it is appropriate to state your
final answer using the appropriate units and/or in a way that relates it
to the meaning.</p>
<div id="AlgebraicSubstitutionExample4" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 1.20</strong>. The formula for converting from
temperature in Fahrenheit to temperature in Celsius is <span
class="math inline">$C=\frac{5}{9}(F-32)$</span>. If the temperature is
<span class="math inline">14<sup>∘</sup>F</span>, what is the
temperature in Celsius?</p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>It is clear that in the formula <span
class="math inline"><em>F</em></span> represents temperature in degrees
Fahrenheit and <span class="math inline"><em>C</em></span> represents
temperature in degrees Celsius. So we substitute given <span
class="math inline"><em>F</em> = 14</span> to get:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}
	C &amp; =\frac{5}{9}(F-32)\\
	&amp;\\
	&amp; = \frac{5}{9}(14-32)\\
	&amp;\\
	&amp; =\frac{5}{9}(-18)\\
	&amp;\\
	&amp; = -10
\end{aligned}$$</span></p>
<p>Since we know the units involved here, it would be most appropriate
to state the final answer as “the temperature is <span
class="math inline">−10<sup>∘</sup>C</span>” or simply “<span
class="math inline">−10<sup>∘</sup>C</span>.”</p>
<p>“<span class="math inline"><em>C</em> = −10</span>” would probably
not be a satisfactory answer in this situation. If you asked someone
“What is <span class="math inline">14<sup>∘</sup></span> Fahrenheit in
Celsius” and they answered “<span
class="math inline"><em>C</em> = −10</span>” you’d probably find that a
pretty strange way of talking.</p>
</div>
<p>Of course, if you don’t know the appropriate units or the context,
then you can only reasonably give the numeric answer.</p>
<div id="AlgebraicSubstitutionExample5" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 1.21</strong>. The formula for the energy stored in a
charged capacitor is <span
class="math inline">$W=\frac{1}{2}cv^2$</span>. Calculate <span
class="math inline"><em>W</em></span> if <span
class="math inline"><em>c</em> = 100</span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>v</em> = 50</span></p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span> <span
class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}
	W &amp; = \frac{1}{2}(100)(50)^2\\
	&amp;\\
	&amp; = \frac{1}{2}(100)(2500)\\
	&amp;\\
	&amp; = \frac{1}{2}(250,000)\\
	&amp;\\
	&amp; = 125,000
\end{aligned}$$</span></p>
<p>In this case, the best we can do is say “the energy stored is <span
class="math inline"><em>W</em> = 125, 000</span>” or even just “<span
class="math inline"><em>W</em> = 125, 000</span>”, since we don’t know
the units. If we don’t know the units or the meaning for a formula,
obviously we can’t be expected to use them in the final answer. If,
however, we did know the units, it would be appropriate to use them.</p>
</div>
<div id="AlgebraicSubstitutionExample6" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 1.22</strong>. The energy, in joules, stored in a
charged capacitor is given by <span
class="math inline">$W=\frac{1}{2}cv^2$</span>, where <span
class="math inline"><em>c</em></span> is the capacitance in farads and
<span class="math inline"><em>v</em></span> is the current in volts.
Determine the energy stored if the capacitance is 100 farads and the
current is 50 volts.</p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>This is the same problem as Example
<a href="#AlgebraicSubstitutionExample5" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="AlgebraicSubstitutionExample5">1.21</a>, except that

answer to this question would be “the energy stored is 125,000 joules”
or just “125,000 joules”.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="input-output-and-your-calculator">Input-Output and Your
Calculator</h3>
<p>Sometimes we have a formula that we need to use repeatedly. Suppose
that you are doing a presentation for a phys ed class where you want to
show the relationship between daily exercise and weight. In your
research, you’ve formulas that predict a person’s weight one year from
now based on how much they exercise. For a 40 year old man who is 5’ 10”
and weighs 200 lbs, and who consumes 2800 calories per day, his
projected weight <span class="math inline"><em>W</em></span> one year
from now is given by the formula:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$W=210-\frac{m}{3}$$</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline"><em>m</em></span> is the number of
minutes of vigorous exercise he gets on average per day.</p>
<p>You don’t think just showing this formula will give your audience a
very good sense of the relationship between exercise and weight, and so
you want to present a table, showing what his projected weight would be
at different levels of exercise, something like this:</p>
<div class="center">
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align: center;">If his average daily vigorous exercise
is:</th>
<th style="text-align: center;">His projected weight in one year would
be:</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;">none</td>
<td style="text-align: center;"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;">30</td>
<td style="text-align: center;"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;">60</td>
<td style="text-align: center;"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;">90</td>
<td style="text-align: center;"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;">120</td>
<td style="text-align: center;"></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<p>To fill in the projected weights in this table, you will need to
substitute each of the different exercise amounts into the formula. This
sort of table is called an input-output table, because it shows the
result (output) you get with each different value you input into the
formula.</p>
<p>It is not difficult to do this by hand, but it is a little tedious.
Your TI-83 or TI-84 calculator has the built-in ability to create tables
for a given formula. Let’s walk through how to use the calculator to
create this table.</p>
<p>First, we need to give the calculator the formula we are using. In
the upper left hand corner of your calculator, you should see a key
labeled “Y=”. Hit this key now and you should see a screen that looks
like this:</p>
<figure>
<div class="picture">
<p>(1,0.66544118) (0,0)<span><embed
src="CalculatorFormulaScreen.pdf" /></span></p>
</div>
<figcaption>Calculator Formula Input Screen</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If there are any formulas already entered, you can either type over
them or delete them using the “CLEAR” key.</p>
<p>The calculator can keep track of multiple formulas at once, but we
only need to use the one right now, so we will just enter our formula on
the Y1 line.</p>
<p>While any letter at all can be used as a variable, the calculator is
not quite so flexible. The input variable (the one you are going to
substitute different values for) must always be X, and the output
variable (the result) must always be Y. Since the “Y1=” is already built
in, we just need to enter the “210-X/3” part of the formula. You can do
that now using the calculator keypad. For the X, you’ll notice a key
labeled “<span class="math inline">X, T, <em>θ</em>, n</span>”. Hitting
that key will give you the X you need. The result should look like
this:</p>
<figure>
<div class="picture">
<p>(1,0.66420668) (0,0)<span><embed
src="CalculatorFormulaEx6.pdf" /></span></p>
</div>
<figcaption>Formula Entered into Calculator</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Now, to set up the table. In the top row of your calculator you will
see a key labeled “WINDOW” with “TBLSET” marked above it. Hit “2nd” and
then that key, and you will arrive at the Table Setup screen, which
should look like this (the specific values on your screen may
differ)</p>
<figure>
<div class="picture">
<p>(1,0.66789672) (0,0)<span><embed
src="CalculatorTableSetupAsk.pdf" /></span></p>
</div>
<figcaption>Calculator Table Setup Screen</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>For our table, the exercise amounts we are inputting start with 0 and
go up in increments of 30 minutes. So, set the value for “TblStart” to
0, and “<span class="math inline"><em>Δ</em></span>Tbl” to 30. The
“<span class="math inline"><em>Δ</em></span>” is the Greek letter delta,
which is commonly used in math and science to represent “change” or
“change in”. So we are telling the calculator to start the table at 0
minutes and then change that input value in increments of 30
minutes.</p>
<p>Next, set “Independent” to Auto. Independent variable is just another
term for input variable; in this case we are telling the calculator to
plug in values of that variable automatically based on our instructions.
If you instead set this to “Ask” you will need to type in the input
values you want to use manually. Dependent variable is another word for
output variable, which we also want the calculator to find
automatically, so we set that to Auto as well. The result should look
like this:</p>
<figure>
<div class="picture">
<p>(1,0.66789672) (0,0)<span><embed
src="CalculatorTableSetupAuto.pdf" /></span></p>
</div>
<figcaption>Calculator Table Setup Screen</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Now we are ready to see our table. In the upper right hand corned
there is a key labeled “GRAPH” and above it the marking “TABLE”. Hit
“2nd” and then that key, and you should see this result:</p>
<figure>
<div class="picture">
<p>(1,0.66789672) (0,0)<span><embed
src="CalculatorTableEx6.pdf" /></span></p>
</div>
<figcaption>Calculator Automatically Generated Table</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Note that even though we only wanted to go as far as 120 minutes, the
calculator keeps going. We never told it where to stop, and we never
actually do. If you don’t care about the values past 120 minutes, just
ignore them. (Likewise, if you want the calculator to go farther, you
can continue the table in either direction by scrolling using the up and
down arrow keys.) And so, now we are ready to put it all together and
make that presentation to our phys ed class:</p>
<div class="center">
<table>

<tr>
<th style="text-align: center;">If his average daily vigorous exercise
is:</th>
<th style="text-align: center;">His projected weight in one year would

<h3 id="tables-with-multiple-inputs">Tables with Multiple Inputs</h3>
<p>The examples we’ve done here with tables both involved formulas where
there was just one input variable. Could we create a table for a formula
where we needed to input more than one value, such as the <span
class="math inline">$W=\frac{1}{2}cv^2$</span> we used in Examples <a
href="#AlgebraicSubstitutionExample4" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="AlgebraicSubstitutionExample4">1.20</a> and <a

data-reference="AlgebraicSubstitutionExample5">1.21</a>?</p>
<p>The TI-83 and 84 calculators can do this, but they are really set up
mainly for tables where there will only be one input value. In our work
in this course, that will be fine. As we will see shortly, most of our
attention in this course will be devoted to problems where there is just
one input variable and one output variable. So we don’t need to concern
ourselves at the moment with calculator tables for multiple inputs. Any
time we need to substitute in multiple values, we will do this by
substituting and evaluating, as we did in Examples <a

<h1 id="foundations-of-algebra">Foundations of Algebra</h1>
<h2 id="AlgebraicExpressions">Algebraic Expressions</h2>
<p>In the last section, we defined algebraic expressions as any
collection of variables and/or numbers tied together by arithmetic
operations. In this section, we’ll explore the rules of working with
these expressions, and put them to work to our advantage.</p>
<p>We also discussed the idea of using algebraic expressions as a
simpler way of expressing mathematical ideas. We observed that instead
of saying “the area of a rectangle is the result of multiplying its
length by its width” we could just write the equation “<span
class="math inline"><em>A</em> = <em>L</em><em>W</em></span>”. The
equation is more concise and lends itself to algebraic substitution when
we need to actually calculate areas. This is the goal and the power of
algebra: to make things as simple as possible (yes, I know, it often
doesn’t feel like it!)</p>
<p>Let’s try another example. Suppose you are working for a landscaping
company that installs brick paver patios, and you need to determine the
price to quote a job. The total cost of the materials will depend on the
area of the patio to be installed. The pavers cost <span
class="math inline">$0.97</span> per square foot, the crushed gravel for
the foundation costs <span class="math inline">23</span> cents per
square foot, and other materials (such as sand) add up to <span
class="math inline">20</span> cents per square foot. The labor for
installation costs <span class="math inline">$2.45</span> per square
foot. In addition, the use of the equipment for the project will cost a
flat <span class="math inline">$425</span>, and your company prices
<span class="math inline">$800</span> into each job for overhead and
profit, with an additional <span class="math inline">20</span> cents per
square foot for overhead and profit as well.</p>
<p>In this scenario, the amount of your quote will depend on just one
thing: the square footage of the patio. If we call that <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>, we can see that the pavers will
cost <span class="math inline">0.97</span> times <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>, the gravel <span
class="math inline">0.20</span> times <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>, and so on. So, the quote for an
<span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> square foot patio can be
expressed algebraically as: <span
class="math display">0.97<em>x</em> + 0.23<em>x</em> + 0.20<em>x</em> + 2.45<em>x</em> + 425 + 800 + 0.20<em>x</em></span></p>
<p>To determine the price for a job, you just would need to plug in the
square footage for <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>, and then
do the arithmetic. But that’s an awful lot of arithmetic. There is a
simpler way. The costs of pavers, gravel, other materials, labor, and
the per-square foot profit and overhead charge all are multiplied by the
square footage. Rather than calculating these each individually, we
could just add <span
class="math inline">$0.97 + $0.23 + $0.20 + $2.45 + $0.20</span> to get
that the total per square-foot cost is <span
class="math inline">$3.85</span>, and so the part of the quote that
depends on the patio’s size is just <span
class="math inline">3.85<em>x</em></span>. Similarly, we can just
combine the <span class="math inline">$425</span> and <span
class="math inline">$800</span> overhead and profit cost to get that
there is <span class="math inline">$425 + $800 = $1225</span> to be
added to the quote regardless of the patio’s size. So, putting them all
together, the quote could also be expressed algebraically as: <span
class="math display">3.85<em>x</em> + 1225</span></p>
<p>Now, it should be clear that both of these algebraic expressions will
give you the same price for the job. But it should also be clear that
the second is going to be a lot easier to work with. What we have done
here is an example of algebraic simplification. <strong>Algebraic
Simplification</strong> is the process of finding simpler algebraic
expressions that are equivalent to more complicated ones.</p>
<p>Of course, if we want the expressions to give the same results, there
must be some rules that we must follow. In this section we will review
some of the main rules and techniques of algebraic simplification.</p>
<h3 id="terms">Terms</h3>
<p>Algebraic expressions can be broken down into terms. A term is a part
of an algebraic expression that is separated from the other parts by
addition (or subtraction, since subtraction is the same as adding a
negative.) The number that is multiplied by everything else in a term is
called its coefficient. The “everything else” is called its literal
part. The following are all examples of terms.</p>
<div class="center">

</div>
<p>A couple of things to note from these examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Every term has a coefficient. <span
class="math inline"><em>q</em><em>r</em><em>t</em></span> can be
rewritten as <span
class="math inline">1<em>q</em><em>r</em><em>t</em></span>, and so if
there is no coefficient written, it is always assumed to be 1 as in
there is one of those terms in the expression.</p></li>
<li><p>Not every term has a literal part. A number by itself is still
considered a term and is referred to as a <strong>constant
term</strong>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, an expression like <span
class="math inline">3.85<em>x</em> + 1225</span> is not a term, because
the <span class="math inline">3.85<em>x</em></span> and the <span
class="math inline">1225</span> are separated from each other by
addition. We would say that this expression consists of two terms: <span
class="math inline">3.85<em>x</em></span> is a term and so is <span
class="math inline">1225</span>.</p>
<p>The expression <span
class="math inline">4<em>x</em><sup>2</sup><em>y</em><sup>3</sup> − 5<em>x</em> + <em>y</em><sup>4</sup> − 3</span>
consists of four terms. While the definition says terms must be
separated by addition, subtraction is the same as adding a negative so
we can rewrite this as <span
class="math inline">4<em>x</em><sup>2</sup><em>y</em><sup>3</sup> + (−5<em>x</em>) + <em>y</em><sup>4</sup> + (−3)</span>.
Usually we don’t actually bother doing this, but we do remember that it
could be done. This has an important consequence, though, which the
following example illustrates.</p>
<div id="AlgebraicExpressionsExample1" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 2.1</strong>. How many terms are there in the
expression <span
class="math inline">2<em>x</em><sup>3</sup> − 3<em>x</em><sup>2</sup> + 5</span>?

</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>There are three terms, separated by
the “<span class="math inline">+</span>” and “<span
class="math inline">−</span>” symbols.</p>
<p>For the first term, <span
class="math inline">2<em>x</em><sup>3</sup></span>, the coefficient is
<span class="math inline">2</span> and the literal part is <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em><sup>3</sup></span>.</p>
<p>For the second term, we need to remember that we could rewrite that
subtraction as adding a negative. We don’t need to actually write this,
but since the definition of a term requires us to at least think of it
this way, we consider the coefficient to be <span
class="math inline">−3</span>. (In other words, we treat subtraction as
a negative coefficient.) The literal part is <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em><sup>2</sup></span>.</p>
<p>For the third term, the coefficient is <span
class="math inline">5</span>, and there is no literal part.</p>
</div>

<div class="adjustwidth">

class="math display">$$\frac{3x}{5y}=\frac{3}{5}\frac{x}{y}$$</span></p>
<p>The coefficient is <span class="math inline">$\displaystyle
\frac{3}{5}$</span> and the literal part is <span
class="math inline">$\displaystyle \frac{x}{y}$</span></p>
</div>
<h3 id="simplifying-terms">Simplifying Terms</h3>
<p>A term can often be written in more than one way. For example, the
term <span class="math display">5<em>x</em><sup>3</sup></span></p>
<p>could also be written as <span
class="math display">5<em>x</em><em>x</em><em>x</em></span></p>
<p>since <span class="math inline"><em>x</em><sup>3</sup></span> is just
a shorter way of writing <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em><em>x</em><em>x</em></span>. But writing
<span class="math inline">5<em>x</em><em>x</em><em>x</em></span>
probably seems strange to you – and it should! We almost always would
rather write our algebraic expressions in the simplest way we can, and
writing out the <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>’s repeatedly
is far less simple than just using an exponent.</p>
<p>We could also write this same term as <span
class="math display"><em>x</em><sup>3</sup>(5)</span></p>
<p>since multiplication is commutative (that is, the order doesn’t
matter when you multiply,) But that probably looks weird to you too. We
almost always write the coefficient of a term at the start of the term.
And because we do this all the time we hardly ever give it any
thought.</p>
<p>A term is considered to be in <strong>simplified form</strong>
whenever:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the coefficient is written at the start of the term, and</p></li>
<li><p>any repeated variables are combined together and written using an
exponent.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So, while <span class="math inline"><em>x</em><sup>3</sup>(5)</span>,
<span class="math inline">5<em>x</em><em>x</em><em>x</em></span>, and
<span class="math inline">5<em>x</em><sup>3</sup></span> are all
perfectly good terms, only <span
class="math inline">5<em>x</em><sup>3</sup></span> would be considered
to be in simplified form.</p>
<p>Now, is the following expression a term? <span
class="math display">(4<em>x</em><em>y</em>)(3<em>x</em><sup>2</sup><em>y</em>)</span></p>
<p>It may look like we have two terms here, but in fact everything in
this expression is tied by multiplication. Nothing is being separated by
addition (or subtraction), so this is actually just a single term. To
see what its coefficient and literal part are, though, we need to do
some rearranging, and put this in simplified form. Since everything is
multiplied, and multiplication is commutative (order doesn’t matter)
<span
class="math display">(4<em>x</em><em>y</em>)(3<em>x</em><sup>2</sup><em>y</em>) = (4)(3)(<em>x</em>)(<em>x</em><em>x</em>)(<em>y</em>)(<em>y</em>) = 12<em>x</em><sup>3</sup><em>y</em><sup>2</sup></span></p>
<p>and so we see the coefficient is <span class="math inline">12</span>
and the literal part is <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em><sup>3</sup><em>y</em><sup>2</sup></span>.</p>
<div id="AlgebraicExpressionsExample3" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 2.3</strong>. How many terms are there in the
expression <span
class="math inline">(3<em>x</em><sup>2</sup>)(2<em>x</em>)(<em>x</em><sup>2</sup>)</span>?
Identify each term’s coefficient and literal part.</p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>Because everything is tied by
multiplication, this is one term. To see the coefficient and literal
part clearly, we’ll simplify the term by multiplying. <span
class="math display">(3<em>x</em><sup>2</sup>)(2<em>x</em>)(<em>x</em><sup>2</sup>) = (3)(2)(1)(<em>x</em><em>x</em>)(<em>x</em>)(<em>x</em><em>x</em>) = 6<em>x</em><sup>5</sup></span></p>
<p>So the coefficient is <span class="math inline">6</span> and the
literal part is <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em><sup>5</sup></span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="AlgebraicExpressionsExample4" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 2.4</strong>. How many terms are there in the
expression <span
class="math inline">(3<em>x</em><sup>2</sup>)(2<em>x</em>) − <em>x</em><sup>2</sup></span>?
Identify each term’s coefficient and literal part.</p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>There are two terms here, separated
by the subtraction. Simplifying by multiplying we get: <span
class="math display">(3<em>x</em><sup>2</sup>)(2<em>x</em>) − <em>x</em><sup>2</sup> = (3)(2)(<em>x</em><em>x</em>)(<em>x</em>) + −1<em>x</em><sup>2</sup> = 6<em>x</em><sup>2</sup> + −1<em>x</em><sup>2</sup></span>.</p>
<p>The first term’s coefficient is <span class="math inline">6</span>
and its literal part is <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em><sup>3</sup></span>. The second term’s
coefficient is <span class="math inline">−1</span> and its <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em><sup>2</sup></span>. Remember that the
coefficient is negative because if we rewrite the expression with the
terms separated by addition.</p>
</div>
<p>What about a term like this? <span
class="math display">(5<em>x</em><sup>35</sup>)(3<em>x</em><sup>49</sup>)(3<em>x</em>)</span></p>
<p>To put this term in simplified form, we can follow the methods used
in the previous examples. But we surely don’t want to write out all
those <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>’s! In practice, what
we do here is to multiply the numbers to get the coefficient, and then
count how many <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>’s are being
multiplied together to determine the appropriate exponent. In this case,
<span class="math inline">5 × 2 × 3 = 30</span> so the coefficient is
<span class="math inline">30</span>. Now, in the first parentheses we
have <span class="math inline"><em>x</em><sup>35</sup></span>, so that
is the same as <span class="math inline">35</span> <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>’s multiplied together. In the
second parentheses we have <span class="math inline">49</span> <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>’s, and in the third we get one
more. So, in total, there are <span
class="math inline">35 + 49 + 1 = 85</span> <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>’s all together. So, the simplified
form of this term is: <span
class="math display">3<em>x</em><sup>85</sup></span></p>
<p>Notice that if we consider <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> to be <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em><sup>1</sup></span>, what we’ve done by
counting the exponents is the same as just adding up the exponents. This
can be stated as the following rule:</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><strong><u>Multiplication Rule for Exponents</u></strong><br />
When multiplying groupings of the same variable raised to powers, you
can just add the powers. (Make sure to remember though that a plain
<span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> is actually treated as <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em><sup>1</sup></span>.)</p>
</div>
<div id="AlgebraicExpressionsExample5" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 2.5</strong>. Rewrite the term <span
class="math inline">(4<em>x</em><em>y</em><sup>4</sup>)(2<em>x</em><sup>7</sup>)(3<em>x</em><sup>12</sup><em>y</em><sup>6</sup>)</span>
in simplified form.</p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>Multiplying the coefficients gives us
an overall coefficient of: <span

<p>Adding the exponents for <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>
we can see the overall exponent for <span

<p>Likewise, the overall exponent for <span

<p>So, the simplified form of this term is: <span

</div>
<h3 id="combining-like-terms">Combining Like Terms</h3>
<p>Suppose you need to replace the carpeting in two bedrooms and the
hallway of an apartment. One bedroom is <span
class="math inline">300</span> square feet in area, the second is <span
class="math inline">210</span> square feet, and the hallway measures
<span class="math inline">90</span> square feet. How much carpet do you
need to replace?</p>
<p>You could say: <span
class="math inline">300<em>f</em><em>t</em><sup>2</sup> + 210<em>f</em><em>t</em><sup>2</sup> + 90<em>f</em><em>t</em><sup>2</sup></span>.
But wouldn’t it be far simpler to just total up the areas and say you
needed to replace <span
class="math inline">600<em>f</em><em>t</em><sup>2</sup></span>?</p>
<p>Because the three measurements are all measuring the same thing (area
to be carpeted) it is both reasonable and simpler to combine them in to
a grand total.</p>
<p>We use the same idea with algebraic expressions. While <span
class="math inline">300<em>x</em><sup>2</sup> + 210<em>x</em><sup>2</sup> + 90<em>x</em><sup>2</sup></span>
is a perfectly good algebraic expression, it would be simpler to just
put all those <span class="math inline"><em>x</em><sup>2</sup></span>
terms together and rewrite the expression as the far simpler <span
class="math inline">600<em>x</em><sup>2</sup></span>. We handle those
“squared <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>‘s” just the same as
we handle square feet.</p>
<p>This is a general rule for algebra. We say that two terms are
<strong>like</strong> if and only if they have the same literal parts.
Like terms can be combined by adding their coefficients (and keeping the
literal part the same).</p>
<div id="AlgebraicExpressionsExample6" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 2.6</strong>. Simplify the expression <span
class="math inline">5<em>x</em><sup>3</sup> − 9<em>x</em><sup>3</sup> + 7<em>x</em><sup>3</sup></span>
by combining like terms.</p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>Since all three terms have the same
literal part (<span class="math inline"><em>x</em><sup>3</sup></span>)
they are all like, and so we combine them by adding their coefficients.
Since <span class="math inline">5 + (−9) + 7 = 3</span>, the expression
simplifies to <span
class="math inline">3<em>x</em><sup>3</sup></span>.</p>
</div>
<p>Now, let’s change things up a little bit. Suppose that you still need
to carpet those two bedrooms, but instead of carpeting the hallway you
need to install a runner, which is not sold by area but instead by
length. The hallway is <span class="math inline">15</span> feet long.
So, you need to put in <span class="math inline">300</span> square feet
and <span class="math inline">210</span> square feet of carpeting, and
<span class="math inline">15</span> feet of runner.</p>
<p>So, we need <span
class="math inline">300<em>f</em><em>t</em><sup>2</sup> + 210<em>f</em><em>t</em><sup>2</sup> + 15<em>f</em><em>t</em></span>.
Now, it still makes sense to combine the square footage of the two
bedrooms. But would it make sense to add <span
class="math inline">15</span> feet to this? Of course not! Area and
length measure to different things, and so we can’t reasonably add them
together. So, we could say we need <span
class="math inline">510<em>f</em><em>t</em><sup>2</sup> + 15<em>f</em><em>t</em></span>,
but we would not combine things any further.</p>
<p>Once again, this idea extends to algebraic expressions. If terms are
unlike (that is, if they are not like) we cannot combine them at
all.</p>
<div id="AlgebraicExpressionsExample7" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 2.7</strong>. Simplify the expression <span
class="math inline">5<em>y</em><sup>3</sup> − 2<em>y</em> + 3<em>y</em> − 11<em>y</em><sup>3</sup></span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>Since addition is commutative, we can
rearrange the <span class="math inline"><em>y</em><sup>3</sup></span>
terms so they can be added together.</p>
<p>Combining the <span class="math inline"><em>y</em><sup>3</sup></span>
terms gives <span
class="math inline">5<em>y</em><sup>3</sup> + −11<em>y</em><sup>3</sup> = −6<em>y</em><sup>3</sup></span>.</p>
<p>Combining the plain <span class="math inline"><em>y</em></span> terms
gives <span
class="math inline">−2<em>y</em> + 3<em>y</em> = 1<em>y</em></span></p>
<p>So, overall we get <span
class="math inline">−6<em>y</em><sup>3</sup> + <em>y</em></span>.</p>
<p>These cannot be combined any further because the two terms in the
expression are unlike.</p>
</div>
<p>In this example we wrote the <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em><sup>3</sup></span> term first. There is
no reason why we cannot write it the other way around; that is <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em> − 6<em>y</em><sup>3</sup></span> would
also be a correct answer. However, we usually write expressions from
highest to lowest powered terms. We will follow that convention in this
book.</p>
<div id="AlgebraicExpressionsExample8" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 2.8</strong>. Simplify the expression <span
class="math inline">3<em>x</em><em>y</em> − 14<em>x</em><sup>2</sup><em>y</em> − 9<em>x</em><em>y</em> + 4 + 8<em>x</em><sup>2</sup><em>y</em> − 1</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">

<span class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}

<h2 id="Distribution">Distribution</h2>
<p>The distributive law, one of the basic laws of arithmetic and
algebra, states that when you have something multiplied by an expression
in parentheses, you can multiply it by each of the terms inside the
parentheses.</p>
<p>Well, that was awfully wordy. It’s far easier to represent this using
symbols: <span
class="math display"><em>a</em>(<em>b</em> + <em>c</em>) = <em>a</em><em>b</em> + <em>a</em><em>c</em></span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline"><em>a</em></span>, <span
class="math inline"><em>b</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>c</em></span> represent any algebraic
expressions at all.</p>
<p>The distributive law is often put to use in simplifying algebraic
expressions, as the next few examples will illustrate.</p>
<div id="DistributionExample1" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 2.9</strong>. Distribute and then simplify the
expression <span
class="math inline">5(2<em>x</em> + 3<em>y</em>)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>Following the distributive law, we
can multiply 5 by each term inside the parentheses: <span
class="math display">5(2<em>x</em> + 3<em>y</em>) = 5(2<em>x</em>) + 5(3<em>y</em>) = 10<em>x</em> + 15<em>y</em></span></p>
</div>
<p>The instructions for example <a href="#DistributionExample1"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="DistributionExample1">2.9</a>
explicitly told us to distribute. Usually, though, it is understood that
distributing whenever possible is a part of simplifying, and so you
should assume that distributing is expected when you are asked to
simplify an expression as in the next example.</p>
<div id="DistributionExample2" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 2.10</strong>. Simplify <span
class="math inline">5<em>x</em>(2<em>x</em><sup>2</sup> + 3<em>x</em> + 1) + 3<em>x</em>(2<em>x</em> − 5)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>We’ll distribute first, and then
simplify each of the resulting terms. Finally, we will combine like
terms. <span class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}
	5x(2x^2+3x+1)+3x(2x-5) &amp; = 5x(2x^2)+5x(3x)+5x(1))+3x(2x)+3x(-5) \\
		&amp; \\
		&amp; = 10x^3+15x^2+5x+6x^2+-15x\\
		&amp; \\
		&amp; = 10x^3 + 21x^2 -10x
\end{aligned}$$</span></p>
</div>
<p>Usually we don’t actually write out the step shown on the second line
in the example above. We usually just combine the steps of distributing
into each term and simplifying, going directly from the first line to
the third. From here on in we will not write out that step in this book,
but whether or not you want to write that step out in your own work is
entirely your choice.</p>
<p>The following example will illustrate a very important point about
distributing when a subtraction is involved. Pay particular attention to
this next example!</p>
<div id="DistributionExample3" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 2.11</strong>. Simplify <span
class="math inline">4<em>x</em>(<em>x</em> − 3) − 3<em>x</em>(<em>x</em> + 2)</span></p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>It is clear that we need to
distribute <span class="math inline">4<em>x</em></span> into the first
set of parentheses. In the second set, though, it is easy to make a
mistake. It appears that we need to just distribute the <span
class="math inline">3<em>x</em></span>, which would give us the
following (incorrect) result: <span
class="math display">$$\text{\underline{Incorrect:}    }
4x^2-12x-3x^2+6x$$</span></p>
<p>The error here is that the “<span class="math inline">−</span>” is
only being applied to the first part of what’s inside those parentheses.
The “<span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>” got the negative, but
the “<span class="math inline">+2</span>” did not.</p>
<p>To treat this correctly, in theory what we should do is to rewrite
<span
class="math inline">4<em>x</em>(<em>x</em> − 3) − 3<em>x</em>(<em>x</em> + 2)</span>
as <span
class="math inline">4<em>x</em>(<em>x</em> − 3) + (−3<em>x</em>)(<em>x</em> + 2)</span>,
using the fact that subtracting is the same as adding a negative. Then
we would distribute the <span class="math inline">−3<em>x</em></span> in
and everything would get the negative. In practice, most people just
remember that when you distribute, the minus gets distributed as
well.</p>
<p>In this case, that means that we’d bring along the “<span
class="math inline">−</span>” and distribute a <span
class="math inline">−3<em>x</em></span> into the <span
class="math inline">(<em>x</em> + 2)</span>. Whichever way you choose to
look at it, the result is the same: <span
class="math display">$$\text{\underline{Correct:}    }
4x(x-3)-3x(x+2)=4x^2-12x-3x^2-6x=x^2-18x$$</span></p>
</div>
<p>Let’s try one additional example before moving on:</p>
<div id="DistributionExample4" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 2.12</strong>. Simplify <span
class="math inline">5<em>x</em>(3<em>x</em> − 1) − 2(<em>x</em><sup>2</sup> − 4<em>x</em> − 3) − 3(4<em>x</em> + 2)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>There are a lot of “<span
class="math inline">−</span>”’s to deal with here. Take your time and be
careful!</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}
5x(3x-1)&amp;-2(x^2-4x-3)-3(4x+2)\\
		&amp; = 5x(3x-1)+(-2)(x^2-4x-3)+(-3)(4x+2)\\
		&amp; = 15x^2-5x-2x^2+8x+6-12x-6\\
		&amp; = 13x^2-9x
\end{aligned}$$</span></p>
</div>
<p>The notion of distribution extends from simple terms as demonstrated
in the following examples:</p>
<div id="DistributionExample5" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 2.13</strong>. Simplify <span
class="math inline">(<em>x</em> + 2)(<em>x</em> + 3)</span></p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>We begin by distributing the second
expression across the addition in the first: <span
class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}
	(x+2)(x+3)&amp; = x(x+3)+2(x+3)\\
		&amp; \\
		&amp; = x^2+3x+2x+6\\
		&amp; \\
		&amp; = x^2+5x+6
\end{aligned}$$</span></p>
</div>
<div id="DistributionExample6" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 2.14</strong>. Simplify <span
class="math inline">(2<em>x</em> − 4)(3<em>x</em> − 1)</span></p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>We distribute and combine like terms:
<span class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}

	&amp; \\
	&amp; = 6x^2-2x-12x+4\\
	&amp; \\
	&amp; = 6x^2-14x+4
\end{aligned}$$</span></p>
</div>
<div id="DistributionExample7" class="example">

<h3 id="exponents-and-division">Exponents and Division</h3>
<p>That covers the multiplication rule. What happens if we have division
of expressions with the same base (or the ratio of two expressions with
the same base)? For example:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$\frac{f^5}{f^2}$$</span></p>
<p>Expanding this expression yields:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$\frac{f \cdot f \cdot f \cdot f \cdot
f}{f \cdot f}$$</span></p>
<p>Since <span class="math inline">$\frac{f}{f}=1$</span>, we can make
use of this with 2 pairs (top and bottom) to produce:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$\frac{f}{f} \cdot \frac{f}{f} \cdot f
\cdot f \cdot f=1 \cdot 1 \cdot f \cdot f \cdot f=f \cdot f \cdot
f=f^3$$</span></p>
<p>Notice that we divided out the <span class="math inline">2</span>
factors of <span class="math inline"><em>f</em></span> in the
denominator from the <span class="math inline">5</span> factors of <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em></span> in the numerator leaving <span
class="math inline">3</span> factors of <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em></span> in the numerator. Do you notice a
connection between the <span class="math inline">5</span> and <span
class="math inline">2</span> that will produce the <span
class="math inline">3</span>?</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$\frac{f^5}{f^2}=f^{5-3}=f^3$$</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p><strong><u>Division Rule for Exponents</u></strong><br />
When dividing groupings of the same variable raised to powers, you can
subtract the powers in the following manner: <span

</div>
<p>Note: In this example we used the fact that anything raised to the
zero power is equal to 1. This come from the observation that any
nonzero quantity divided by itself is equal to 1. In this example <span

<p>What does <span class="math inline">10<sup>−3</sup></span> represent?
Typing it into your calculator yields a value of <span
class="math inline">0.001</span>. Why?</p>
<p>We think of a positive integer exponent indicating repeated
multiplication. For example, <span
class="math inline">10<sup>4</sup> = 10 ⋅ 10 ⋅ 10 ⋅ 10 = 10, 000</span>.
A negative integer exponent can be viewed as indicative of repeated
division. For example;</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$\displaystyle 10^{-3} = 1\cdot 10^{-3} =
1 \div 10 \div 10 \div 10 = \frac{1}{10 \cdot 10 \cdot
10}=\frac{1}{10^3}$$</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p><strong><u>Negative Exponents</u></strong><br />
We define <span class="math display">$$\displaystyle
x^{-a}=\frac{1}{x^a}$$</span></p>
</div>
<div id="NegativeExponentsExample1" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 2.29</strong>. Simplify the expression <span
class="math inline">2<sup>−4</sup></span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>Using the definition for negative
exponents: <span class="math display">$$\displaystyle
2^{-4}=\frac{1}{2^4}=\frac{1}{16}=0.0625$$</span></p>
</div>
<p>Ok. Now let’s back up a little bit. What happens if we start with
<span class="math inline">$\displaystyle \frac{10^2}{10^5}$</span>?
Expanding this expression: <span class="math display">$$\displaystyle
\frac{10 \cdot 10}{10 \cdot 10 \cdot 10 \cdot 10 \cdot 10} =
\frac{10}{10} \cdot\frac{10}{10} \cdot\frac{1}{10 \cdot 10 \cdot 10} = 1
\cdot 1 \cdot \frac{1}{10^3}$$</span></p>
<p>This confirms that the division rule works even in cases when the
exponent in the numerator is less than the exponent in the denominator
applied to the same base. In other words: <span
class="math display">$$\displaystyle \frac{10^2}{10^5} = 10^{2-5} =
10^{-3} = \frac{1}{10^3}$$</span></p>
<p>Armed with this new insight, we can now practice simplifying
expression that didn’t fit into the same patterns as what we’ve worked
on so far.</p>
<div id="NegativeExponentsExample2" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 2.30</strong>. Simplify the expression below and

<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>Applying the division rule: <span
class="math display">$$\frac{a^5}{a^9}=a^{5-9}=a^{-4}$$</span></p>

<span class="math display">$$a^{-4}=\frac{1}{a^4}$$</span></p>
</div>
<div id="NegativeExponentsExample3" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 2.31</strong>. Simplify the expression below and

class="math display">$$\frac{10}{5x^{-6}}$$</span></p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>This expression is a bit different,
as our base with the negative power is now in the denominator of our
fractions. One approach to simplify this is as follows:</p>
<p>Rewriting the expression as a product: <span
class="math display">$$\frac{10}{5x^{-6}}=\frac{10}{5}\cdot\frac{1}{x^{-6}}=2
\cdot \frac{1}{x^{-6}}=\frac{2}{x^{-6}}$$</span></p>
<p>Here, we will use the definition that <span
class="math inline">$x^{-a}=\frac{1}{x^a}$</span> to rewrite this
expression without a negative exponent:</p>
<p>Rewriting the expression as a product again: <span
class="math display">$$\frac{10}{5x^{-6}}=2 \cdot
\frac{1}{x^{-6}}$$</span></p>
<p>Rewriting without the negative exponent: <span
class="math display">$$\frac{10}{5x^{-6}}=2 \cdot
\frac{1}{\left(\frac{1}{x^{6}}\right)}$$</span></p>
<p>Then we multiply the numerator and denominator by the reciprocal of
the denominator to simplify. The reciprocal of <span
class="math inline">$\frac{1}{x^6}$</span> is <span
class="math inline">$\frac{x^6}{1}=x^6$</span>. <span
class="math display">$$\frac{10}{5x^{-6}}=2 \cdot
\frac{1}{\left(\frac{1}{x^{6}}\right)}=2 \cdot \frac{1 \cdot
x^6}{\left(\frac{1}{x^{6}}\right)\cdot\left(\frac{x^{6}}{1}\right)}=2\cdot
\frac{x^6}{\left(\frac{x^6}{x^6}\right)}$$</span></p>
<p>Here we identify that <span class="math inline">$\frac{x^6}{x^6} =
1$</span> and we obtain: <span
class="math display">$$\frac{10}{5x^{-6}}=2\cdot\frac{x^6}{1}=2x^6$$</span></p>
</div>
<p>Note: it is not “bad” or incorrect to have a negative exponent in an
expression or an equation. We are practicing rewriting expressions with
and without negative exponents to reinforce what they represent.</p>

<h2 id="CommonFactor">Factoring: Common Factor</h2>
<p>What is a factor?</p>
<p>When it comes to multiplying, a <u>factor</u> is one of the things
being multiplied and the <u>product</u> is the result that is obtained
from multiplying. For example in the equation <span
class="math inline">2 ⋅ 6 = 12</span>, <span
class="math inline">2</span> and <span class="math inline">6</span> are
factors and the product is <span class="math inline">12</span>.</p>
<p>Recall from section <a href="#Distribution" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="Distribution">2.2</a>; the distributive law gives us
<span
class="math inline"><em>a</em>(<em>b</em> + <em>c</em>) = <em>a</em><em>b</em> + <em>a</em><em>c</em></span>.
Here <span class="math inline"><em>a</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>b</em> + <em>c</em></span> are the factors and
the product is <span
class="math inline"><em>a</em><em>b</em> + <em>a</em><em>c</em></span>.</p>
<p>Putting this into a context, we have <span
class="math inline">3(<em>x</em> + 5) = 3<em>x</em> + 15</span> with
factors <span class="math inline">3</span> and <span
class="math inline">(<em>x</em> + 5)</span> and a product of <span
class="math inline">3<em>x</em> + 15</span>.</p>
<h3 id="common-factor">Common Factor</h3>
<p>We can use a common factor to reverse the distributive law we were
introduced to in section <a href="#Distribution"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="Distribution">2.2</a>. A
common factor is a term that divides each term of the expression. We are
looking for our result to be <strong>factored completely</strong> ,
meaning that there are no other factors that can be divided out. When
looking at the example above, <span class="math inline">3</span> is a
common factor of the expression <span
class="math inline">3<em>x</em> + 15</span> because <span
class="math inline">3</span> divides both <span
class="math inline">3<em>x</em></span> and <span
class="math inline">15</span> evenly.</p>
<div id="CommonFactorExample1" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 2.34</strong>. Factor the expression <span
class="math inline">10<em>x</em><sup>2</sup> + 25<em>x</em></span></p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>We are looking for a common factor
that divides both <span
class="math inline">10<em>x</em><sup>2</sup></span> and <span
class="math inline">25<em>x</em></span>. Beginning with the
coefficients, <span class="math inline">5</span> divides both <span
class="math inline">10</span> and <span class="math inline">25</span>
and the highest power of <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>
that divides both <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em><sup>2</sup></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> is <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>. Therefore our common factor of
<span class="math inline">10<em>x</em><sup>2</sup></span> and <span
class="math inline">25<em>x</em></span> is <span
class="math inline">5<em>x</em></span>. When we divide both terms in our
original expression by <span class="math inline">5<em>x</em></span>, we
have: <span class="math display">$$\displaystyle \frac{10x^2}{5x} +
\frac{25x}{5x} = \frac{\cancel{10}^{~2}\cdot \cancel{x}^{~1} \cdot
x}{\cancel{5}^{~1}\cdot\cancel{x}^{~1}} +
\frac{\cancel{25}^{~5}\cdot\cancel{x}^{~1}}{\cancel{5}^{~1}\cdot\cancel{x}^{~1}}
= \frac{2x}{1} + \frac{5}{1} = 2x+5$$</span></p>
<p>and we obtain: <span
class="math display">10<em>x</em><sup>2</sup> + 25<em>x</em> = 5<em>x</em>(2<em>x</em> + 1)</span></p>
</div>
<p>Because the terms <span class="math inline">2<em>x</em></span> and
<span class="math inline">5</span> share no other common factors (other
than 1) we have completely factored our expression. We can use the
distributive law to check if our factored expression is correct: <span
class="math display">5<em>x</em>(2<em>x</em> + 1) = 5<em>x</em>(2<em>x</em>) + 5<em>x</em>(5) = 10<em>x</em><sup>2</sup> + 25<em>x</em></span></p>
<p>When multiplying the factors <span
class="math inline">5<em>x</em></span> and <span
class="math inline">2<em>x</em> + 5</span>, our product was the
expression we started with, so we can see we factored the expression
appropriately.</p>

\frac{20x^2}{2x^2} = \frac{\cancel{4}^{~2} \cdot \cancel{x}^{~1}
\cdot\cancel{x}^{~1} \cdot x}{\cancel{2}^{~1}\cdot\cancel{x}^{~1}
\cdot\cancel{x}^{~1}} + \frac{\cancel{20}^{~10}\cdot\cancel{x}^{~1}
\cdot\cancel{x}^{~1}}{\cancel{2}^{~1}\cdot\cancel{x}^{~1}
\cdot\cancel{x}^{~1}} = \frac{2x}{1} + \frac{10}{1} = 2x+10$$</span></p>
<p>so the factorization we have obtained is <span
class="math inline">4<em>x</em><sup>3</sup> + 20<em>x</em><sup>2</sup> = 2<em>x</em><sup>2</sup>(2<em>x</em> + 10)</span>.</p>
<p>However, the terms inside the parenthesis share another common factor
of <span class="math inline">2</span>, so our result is <u>not
completely factored</u>. We would then have to factor out another <span
class="math inline">2</span>, leaving us with: <span
class="math display">4<em>x</em><sup>3</sup> + 20<em>x</em><sup>2</sup> = 2<em>x</em><sup>2</sup>(2<em>x</em> + 10) = 2<em>x</em><sup>2</sup>(2)(<em>x</em> + 5) = 4<em>x</em><sup>2</sup>(<em>x</em> + 5)</span></p>
<p>Notice that the common factor after we divided out another <span
class="math inline">2</span>, becomes <span
class="math inline">4<em>x</em><sup>2</sup></span>. If we had originally
divided both terms in our original expression by <span
class="math inline">4<em>x</em><sup>2</sup></span>, we would have <span
class="math inline">4<em>x</em><sup>2</sup>(<em>x</em> + 5)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>Although we have the same result in either case, it is more efficient
to factor out <span class="math inline">4<em>x</em><sup>2</sup></span>
initially as it has a larger coefficient than <span
class="math inline">2<em>x</em><sup>2</sup></span>. We can call <span
class="math inline">4<em>x</em><sup>2</sup></span> the <u>greatest
common factor (GCF)</u> of <span
class="math inline">4<em>x</em><sup>3</sup></span> and <span
class="math inline">20<em>x</em><sup>2</sup></span> because that is the
factor with the largest coefficient and highest degree literal part that
divides both terms.</p>
<div id="CommonFactorExample3" class="example">

variable cannot be a part of our common factor. Therefore, our greatest

we have: <span class="math display">$$\displaystyle \frac{3x}{3} +

<p>and we obtain: <span

<p>Because the terms <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> and

<p>We can also consider a common factor of <span

<p>Looking back to the beginning of this section, specifically at the

we can see that the two terms share a common factor of <span

<span class="math inline"><em>a</em>(<em>b</em> + <em>c</em>)</span>. In
some cases, it will be appropriate to use an expression with more than

<h3 id="factor-by-grouping">Factor by Grouping</h3>

<p>The factors of <span class="math inline">−10</span> and <span
class="math inline">3</span> give us the sum and product that we are
looking for. Therefore, we can factor <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em><sup>2</sup> − 7<em>x</em> − 30</span>
into <span
class="math inline">(<em>x</em> − 10)(<em>x</em> + 3)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="SecondDegreeFactorExample4" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 2.46</strong>. Factor <span
class="math inline">2<em>x</em><sup>2</sup> + 16<em>x</em> + 30</span></p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>It is important to recognize here
that the coefficient of the <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em><sup>2</sup></span> terms here does not
equal <span class="math inline">1</span>. We can however, begin by
dividing by a common factor, which in this case is <span
class="math inline">2</span> and once we do that we are left with: <span
class="math display">2<em>x</em><sup>2</sup> + 16<em>x</em> + 30 = 2(<em>x</em><sup>2</sup> + 8<em>x</em> + 15)</span></p>
<p>Remember that we want to be sure we have factored our expression
completely. We have to then attempt to factor what we have inside the
parenthesis. We are looking for factors of <span
class="math inline">15</span>, whose sum is <span
class="math inline">8</span>. We check the factors of <span
class="math inline">15</span>, (<span class="math inline">15</span>,
<span class="math inline">1</span> - sum <span
class="math inline">16</span>), (<span
class="math inline">5</span>,<span class="math inline">3</span> - sum
<span class="math inline">8</span>). We need the pair <span
class="math inline">5</span>, <span class="math inline">3</span>. We can
then factor <span
class="math inline">2<em>x</em><sup>2</sup> + 16<em>x</em> + 2</span>
into <span
class="math inline">2(<em>x</em> + 5)(<em>x</em> + 3)</span>.</p>

<div id="SecondDegreeFactorExample5" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 2.47</strong>. Factor: <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em><sup>3</sup> + <em>x</em><sup>2</sup> − 6<em>x</em></span></p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>You will notice that this expression
is not in fact second degree because of the presence of the <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em><sup>3</sup></span>, this is a third
degree expression. We can however use the same ideas to factor this
expression and begin by looking for a common factor between the three
terms. There is no common factor between the coefficients other than 1.
For the literal part, the highest power of <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> that is a factor of <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em><sup>3</sup></span>, <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em><sup>2</sup></span>, and <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> is <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>. Therefore, the common factor is
<span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>. Once we factor that out we
are left with: <span
class="math display"><em>x</em><sup>3</sup> + <em>x</em><sup>2</sup> − 6<em>x</em> = <em>x</em>(<em>x</em><sup>2</sup> + <em>x</em> − 6)</span></p>
<p>To factor completely, we need factors of <span
class="math inline">−6</span> whose sum is <span
class="math inline">1</span> (remember that the middle term, <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>, is equivalent to <span
class="math inline">1<em>x</em></span>). The pairs to consider are
(<span class="math inline">6</span>, <span class="math inline">−1</span>
- sum <span class="math inline">5</span>), (<span
class="math inline">−6</span>, <span class="math inline">1</span> - sum
<span class="math inline">−5</span>), (<span
class="math inline">−3</span>,<span class="math inline">2</span> - sum
<span class="math inline">−1</span>), and (<span
class="math inline">3</span>, <span class="math inline">−2</span> - sum
<span class="math inline">1</span>). We need the pair <span
class="math inline">3</span>, <span class="math inline">−2</span>. We
can then factor <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em><sup>3</sup> + <em>x</em><sup>2</sup> − 6<em>x</em></span>
into <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em>(<em>x</em> + 3)(<em>x</em> − 2)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="SecondDegreeFactorExample6" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 2.48</strong>. Factor: <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em><sup>2</sup> − 25</span></p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>Notice that there are only <span
class="math inline">2</span> terms in this expression, which leads us to
believe that the coefficient of the “middle term” must be <span
class="math inline">0</span>. We can think of this expression as <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em><sup>2</sup> + 0<em>x</em> − 25</span>. We
can factor in the same way we had in the previous examples, factors of
<span class="math inline">−25</span> whose sum is <span
class="math inline">0</span>. Our options are (<span
class="math inline">25</span>, <span class="math inline">−1</span> – sum
<span class="math inline">24</span>), (<span
class="math inline">−25</span>,<span class="math inline">1</span> - sum
<span class="math inline">−24</span>) or (<span
class="math inline">−5</span>, <span class="math inline">5</span> - sum
<span class="math inline">0</span>). We need the pair <span
class="math inline">5</span>, <span class="math inline">−5</span>. We
can then factor <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em><sup>2</sup> − 25</span> into <span
class="math inline">(<em>x</em> + 5)(<em>x</em> − 5)</span>.</p>
<p>Let’s use the distributive law to check our solution: <span
class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}
	(x+5)(x-5) &amp; = x(x)+x(-5)+5(x)+5(-5)\\
	&amp; \\
	&amp; = x^2-5x+5x-25\\
	&amp; \\
	&amp; = x^2-25
\end{aligned}$$</span></p>
</div>
<p>Notice that the pair of integers we used were the same number with
opposite signs. This caused the middle term to simplify to <span
class="math inline">0</span> when combining like terms. Also note that
multiplying a number by itself is “squaring” that number (<span
class="math inline">5 ⋅ 5 = 25</span>) giving us a product that is a
perfect square!</p>
<p>When we have a second degree expression in the form <span
class="math inline"><em>a</em><sup>2</sup> − <em>b</em><sup>2</sup></span>
we can refer to that as the <strong>difference of squares</strong> and
factor into <span
class="math inline">(<em>a</em> + <em>b</em>)(<em>a</em> − <em>b</em>)</span>.
This pattern requires subtraction in the original expression because
that is how our middle terms were eliminated when combined.</p>

class="math inline"><em>t</em><sup>2</sup> − 36</span></p>

knowing that <span

<h1 id="solving-equations">Solving Equations</h1>
<h2 id="FirstDegreeEquations">Solving First Degree Equations</h2>
<p>Usually our main goal in algebra is to solve problems by solving
equations. In this book we’ll spend quite a bit of time working on
techniques to do this, but you should already have some experience. In
this chapter we will review techniques of solving first-degree
equations. Speaking a bit loosely, a <strong>first-degree
equation</strong> can be defined to be one where we don’t need to deal
with exponents, roots, variables in denominators, or anything like
that.</p>
<p>Before we begin reviewing, let’s review some of the terminology we’ll
need to use. Suppose you have a <span class="math inline">$25</span>
balance on a pre-paid phone card, and usage costs <span
class="math inline">3</span> cents per minute. You can write an
algebraic expression for the balance on your card based on minutes used.
If we represent the minutes used by the variable <span
class="math inline"><em>m</em></span>, your remaining balance would be
<span class="math inline">25 − 0.03<em>m</em></span>. You can find out
what your balance would be after any number of minutes of usage just by
plugging in different values for <span
class="math inline"><em>m</em></span>. How much would you have after
<span class="math inline">200</span> minutes? Plug in <span
class="math inline"><em>m</em> = 200</span>! And so on.</p>
<p>But now suppose you want to know how many minutes you can use before
your balance falls to <span class="math inline">$10</span>. So, in other
words, you need to solve the equation: <span
class="math display">25 − 0.03<em>m</em> = 10</span></p>
<p>Now, most values that we might plug in for <span
class="math inline"><em>m</em></span> will not make this equation true.
If we plug in, say, <span class="math inline"><em>m</em> = 200</span>,
we would get: <span class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}
	25 - 0.03(200) &amp; = 10 \\
	25 - 6 &amp; = 10 \\
	19 &amp; = 10	
\end{aligned}$$</span></p>
<p>which is nonsense. If you use <span class="math inline">200</span>
minutes, we can see that your remaining balance is <span
class="math inline">$19</span>, not the <span
class="math inline">$10</span> we were looking for. <span
class="math inline">200</span> minutes is not the amount of usage you
were looking for.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if we plug in <span
class="math inline"><em>m</em> = 500</span>, we get: <span
class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}
	25 - 0.03(500) &amp; = 10 \\
	25 - 15 &amp; = 10 \\
	10 &amp; = 10
\end{aligned}$$</span></p>
<p>which is exactly what we would have hoped for. If you use <span
class="math inline">500</span> minutes, your remaining balance is <span
class="math inline">$10</span>. <span class="math inline">500</span>
minutes is the amount of usage you were looking for.</p>
<p>In algebra, we say that a given value <strong>satisfies</strong> an
equation if and only if the result is true when we plug that value into
the equation. We can also say that a given value is a solution for the
equation. So, in this example, we would say that “<span
class="math inline">500</span> satisfies the equation <span
class="math inline">25 − 0.03<em>m</em> = 10</span>” or that “<span
class="math inline">500</span> is a solution for this equation.”</p>
<p>Likewise we would say that “<span class="math inline">200</span> does
not satisfy (or is not a solution for) this equation.”</p>
<p>The set of all solutions for a given equation is called its solution
set. We would say that the solution set of <span
class="math inline">25 − 0.03<em>m</em> = 10</span> is <span
class="math inline">{500}</span> (this solution set has just one
member.) We know that <span class="math inline">500</span> must be the
only member of this solution set because common sense tells us that
there is only one amount of usage that would result in having <span
class="math inline">$10</span> left.</p>
<p>Most first-degree equations have only one solution, but equations can
have multiple solutions. For example, suppose that using physics someone
has determined that the expression <span
class="math inline">64<em>t</em> − 16<em>t</em><sup>2</sup></span> gives
the height of a ball (in feet) <span
class="math inline"><em>t</em></span> seconds after it is thrown upward,
and we want to know when the ball will be at a height of <span
class="math inline">48</span> feet. So we would need to know the
solution set for the equation <span
class="math inline">64 − 16<em>t</em><sup>2</sup> = 48</span>. (Note
that this is not a first-degree equation, because of the squared term).
It turns out that this equation has two solutions, <span
class="math inline"><em>t</em> = 1</span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>t</em> = 3</span>, so the ball is at a height of
<span class="math inline">48</span> feet <span
class="math inline">1</span> second and <span
class="math inline">3</span> seconds after it is thrown. So the solution
set is <span class="math inline">{1, 3}</span>. It makes perfect sense
that there would be two solutions for this equation, since the ball
would reach this height twice, once on the way up, and once on the way
down. Common sense also tells us that these must be the only two
solutions to the equation, since the ball would not be at this height at
any other time.</p>

	3-2 &amp; = 10 \\
	1 &amp; = 10

Using the Balance Principle</h3>
<p>Of course, it’s one thing to check whether or not a given value
satisfies an equation. It’s quite another to figure out an equation’s
solution(s) without being given values to try. If we had not been given
the value of <span class="math inline"><em>m</em> = 500</span> to try in
our phone care example, how would we have known to try it? This is the
great challenge of algebra.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>“Balancing” is one of the most fundamental principles used in
algebra. The basic idea is this: think of an equation as a balanced
scale. The two sides of the equation are equal, and so if we placed them
on an imaginary scale, the scale would balance. If you change the value
of one side of the equation (say by adding or subtracting something to
it, or multiplying or dividing it by something) the scale will no longer
be in balance. But you can recover that balance by making the same
change to the other side.</p>
<p>This all boils down to the following rule:</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><strong><u>The Balance Principle</u></strong><br />
You can make any change you like to one side of an equation, as long as
you make an equivalent change to the other side.</p>
</div>
<p>In algebra, we exploit this rule all the time. Let’s walk through a
very basic example to review how it works, and then we’ll proceed to
some more complicated problems.</p>
<p>Suppose we want to solve: <span
class="math display">25 − 0.03<em>m</em> = 10</span></p>
<p>and let’s also forget that anyone ever said anything about trying any
particular values as solutions. Let’s just suppose we are given the
equation and are asked to determine its solution.</p>
<p>So, our goal is to get an equation which directly tells us the
correct value of <span class="math inline"><em>m</em></span>. So, what
we will do here is to try to transform the given equation into something
that just has the variable <span class="math inline"><em>m</em></span>
isolated on one side, and a number on the other side.</p>
<p>Let’s begin by getting rid of the <span
class="math inline">25</span>. We can eliminate that <span
class="math inline">25</span> on the left by subtracting it - and we are
allowed to do that so long as we also subtract <span
class="math inline">25</span> from the right, to keep the equation
balanced. So: <span class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}
	25-0.03m\bm{-25} &amp; = 10\bm{-25}\\
	-0.03m &amp; = -15
\end{aligned}$$</span></p>
<p>Now, we don’t have <span class="math inline"><em>m</em></span>
isolated yet, but we’re closer. We now just have to get rid of the
coefficient <span class="math inline">−0.03</span>. Now, it is a common
mistake to try to do this by adding <span
class="math inline">0.03</span> to both sides, but that won’t work
because <span class="math inline">−0.03<em>m</em></span> and <span
class="math inline">0.03</span> are not like terms, and so they cannot
be combined. But we can divide both sides by <span
class="math inline">−0.03</span>: <span
class="math display">$$\frac{-0.03m}{\bm{-0.03}} =
\frac{-15}{\bm{-0.03}}$$</span></p>
<p>Which gives us: <span
class="math display"><em>m</em> = 500</span></p>
<p>So we conclude that the solution is <span
class="math inline"><em>m</em> = 500</span>. Stating this solution in
terms appropriate for the question at hand we might phrase it as “<span
class="math inline">500</span> minutes of usage”. We can also feel
confident that this is the only solution, because this is the only
solution that we arrived at by following the methods of algebra.</p>
<p>Using the principle of balance to transform an equation into one
which explicitly states its solution is one of the primary methods of
algebra, and really the only technique we will be using in this chapter.
However, with more complicated equations, the strategies to use to get
the variable by itself may be more involved. The following examples will
illustrate how the principle of balance can be used effectively with
some of these more complicated equations.</p>
<div id="FirstDegreeEquationsExample2" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 3.2</strong>. Solve for <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>: <span
class="math display">5<em>x</em> − 11 + 3(2<em>x</em> − 3) = 2</span></p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span> Before putting the principle of
balance to work on this, it would be best to simplify by distributing
and combining like terms. So: <span
class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}
		5x-11+3(2x-3)&amp;=2\\
		5x-11+6x-9&amp;=2\\
		11x-20&amp;=2
	
\end{aligned}$$</span></p>
<p>From here, we just need to add <span class="math inline">20</span>
and then divide by <span class="math inline">11</span> to get isolate
the <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>: <span
class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}
		11x-20&amp;=2\\
		11x&amp;=22\\
		x&amp;=2
	
\end{aligned}$$</span></p>
<p>It never hurts to check your answers by substituting your solution
back into the original equation: <span
class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}
		5x-11+3(2x-3)&amp;=2\\
		5(2)-11+3(2(2)-3)&amp;=2\\
		2&amp;=2
	
\end{aligned}$$</span></p>
<p>Since the equation holds true when we substitute in <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em> = 2</span>, the solution checks as
correct.</p>
</div>
<p>Often we run into equations where the variable appears on both sides.
In those cases, the best strategy is usually to first simply both sides
as much as possible, and then collect all the variable terms together on
one side, and all the non-variable terms on the other. The following
example will illustrate:</p>
<div id="FirstDegreeEquationsExample3" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 3.3</strong>. Solve for <span
class="math inline"><em>z</em></span>: <span
class="math display">5(<em>z</em> + 1) − 16 = 3<em>z</em> − 5</span></p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span> <span
class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}
		5(z+1)-16&amp;=3z-5\\
		5z+5-16&amp;=3z-5\\
		5z-11&amp;=3z-5
	
\end{aligned}$$</span></p>
<p>It doesn’t matter which side we collect the <span
class="math inline"><em>z</em></span>’s on; either is fine. It is more
common to collect them on the left, so we’ll subtract <span
class="math inline">3<em>z</em></span> from both sides to get: <span
class="math display">2<em>z</em> − 11 = −5</span></p>
<p>Now since we’ve collected <span
class="math inline"><em>z</em></span>’s on the left, we’ll add <span
class="math inline">11</span> to both sides to get rid of the <span
class="math inline">−11</span> on the left: <span
class="math display">2<em>z</em> = 6</span></p>
<p>And now dividing both sides by 2 we get: <span
class="math display"><em>z</em> = 3</span></p>
<p>A check confirms the result: <span
class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}
		5(z+1)-16&amp;=3z-5\\
		5(3+1)-16&amp;=3(3)-5\\
		4&amp;=4
	
\end{aligned}$$</span></p>
</div>
<p>Let’s try one more example before moving on.</p>
<div id="FirstDegreeEquationsExample4" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 3.4</strong>. Solve for <span
class="math inline"><em>t</em></span>: <span
class="math display">4<em>t</em> − 3 − 7(2 − <em>t</em>) = 2(7<em>t</em> + 5) − (<em>t</em> − 4)</span></p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span> As before, we’ll simplify each side
first. Remember that you need to be careful about the negatives when
distributing! <span class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}
		4t-3-7(2-t)&amp;=2(7t+5)-(t-4)\\
		\\
		4t-3-14+7t&amp;=14t+10-t+4\\
		\\
		11t-17&amp;=13t+14
	
\end{aligned}$$</span></p>
<p>Now, as mentioned in the previous example, there is a tendency to
collect the variable on the left. So, if we collect the variable on the
left we subtract <span class="math inline">13<em>t</em></span> from both
sides to get: <span
class="math display">−2<em>t</em> − 17 = 14</span></p>
<p>Then add <span class="math inline">17</span> to both sides: <span
class="math display">−2<em>t</em> = 31</span></p>
<p>And now divide by <span class="math inline">−2</span>: <span
class="math display">$$t=\frac{31}{-2}$$</span></p>
<p>which is more commonly rewritten as: <span
class="math display">$$t=-\frac{31}{2}=\frac{-31}{2}=-15.5$$</span></p>
<p>Some people feel a strong preference against negative coefficients if
they can be avoided, and so might prefer to subtract <span
class="math inline">11<em>t</em></span> from both sides. That is also
fine, and in fact we can do this and then switch the equation’s sides if
we want to. So this is also a correct solution: <span
class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}
		4t-3-7(2-t)&amp;=2(7t+5)-(t-4)\\
		\\
		4t-3-14+7t&amp;=14t+10-t+4\\
		\\
		11t-17&amp;=13t+14\\
		\\
		-17&amp;=2t+14\\
		\\
		-31&amp;=2t\\
		\\
		-\frac{31}{2}&amp;=t
	
\end{aligned}$$</span></p>
<p>Finally, to check. We’ll substitute this solution into the original
equation. Since the arithmetic gets tedious, typing each side’s
expression into the calculator is probably the best choice; remember
though to be careful to use parentheses appropriately when substituting
in this negative number: <span class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}
		4t-3-7(2-t)&amp;=2(7t+5)-(t-4)\\
		\\
		4\left(\frac{-31}{2}\right)-3-7\left[2-\left(\frac{-31}{2}\right)\right]&amp;=2\left[7\left(\frac{-31}{2}\right)+5\right]-\left[\left(\frac{-31}{2}\right)-4\right]\\
		\\
		-187.5&amp;=-187.5
	
\end{aligned}$$</span></p>
</div>
<p>As the choice discussed in the above example makes clear, we often
have some choice about the order we do things. While the examples given
in this book are meant to illustrate sound strategy, all of these
problems can be correctly solved in other ways as well. <strong>As long
as the steps you take follow the laws of algebra</strong> you will
arrive at a correct solutions.</p>
<h3 id="solving-equations-involving-fractions">Solving Equations
Involving Fractions</h3>
<p>When equations involve fractions, the same principles apply, but the
arithmetic can quickly become tedious. Arithmetic with fractions is much
more work than arithmetic with whole numbers, even when using a
calculator.</p>
<p>We can avoid fraction arithmetic by multiplying both sides of the
equation through by a common denominator. This technique is known as
<strong>clearing the fractions</strong>. The following example will
illustrate.</p>
<div id="FirstDegreeEquationsExample5" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 3.5</strong>. Solve for <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em></span>: <span
class="math display">$$\frac{2}{3}y-\frac{7}{5}=\frac{1}{6}y+\frac{11}{4}$$</span></p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span> Among the denominators <span
class="math inline">3, 5, 6,</span> and <span
class="math inline">4</span> is 60. So, to clear the fractions, we start
by multiplying both sides by 60. <span
class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}
		60\left(\frac{2}{3}y-\frac{7}{5}\right)&amp;=60\left(\frac{1}{6}y+\frac{11}{4}\right)
\\
		\\
		60\left(\frac{2}{3}y\right)-60\left(\frac{7}{5}\right)&amp;=60\left(\frac{1}{6}y\right)+60\left(\frac{11}{4}\right)\\
		\\
		\frac{120}{3}y-\frac{420}{5}&amp;=\frac{60}{6}y+\frac{660}{4}\\
		\\
		40y-84&amp;=10y+165
	
\end{aligned}$$</span></p>
<p>Now, notice what happened when we multiplied; because all of the
denominators divide 60 evenly, the result in each term is a whole
number. Now we can just continue as we have before: <span
class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}
		40y-84&amp;=10y+165 \\
		\\
		30y-84&amp;=165 \\
		\\

<p>The reduction of the fraction to lowest terms is useful for
expressing the exact answer to the equation. This answer can be checked
by substituting back into the original equation (use your calculator for
the arithmetic!)</p>
</div>
<p>It is not absolutely necessary to use the lowest common denominator
to clear the fractions from an equation; any common denominator will
work. So in the previous example, we could also have just multiplied all
the denominators together to get a common denominator and so multiplied
both sides by <span class="math inline">(3)(5)(6)(4) = 360</span>. This
would have worked out just fine, though the numbers we would have gotten
would have been larger after clearing. The benefit of using the lowest
common denominator is that it keeps the numbers as small as possible.
That is nice, but not mandatory.</p>
<p>Be careful when clearing the fractions if the original equation
contains parentheses. When fractions fall inside parentheses, sometimes
you may need to multiply through by a common denominator more than once
to fully clear all the fractions. The following two examples will
illustrate this.</p>
<div id="FirstDegreeEquationsExample6" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 3.6</strong>. Solve for <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>: <span
class="math display">$$\frac{2}{3}x-1=\frac{3}{5}\left(\frac{1}{2}x+1\right)$$</span></p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span> Here the lowest common denominator
is <span class="math inline">30</span>, so we multiply both sides: <span
class="math display">$$30\left(\frac{2}{3}x-1\right)=30\left[\frac{3}{5}\left(\frac{1}{2}x+1\right)\right]$$</span></p>
<p>When simplifying we generally work from inside parentheses out, but
here we are better off multiplying 30 into the outermost parenthesis on
the right first: <span
class="math display">$$30\left(\frac{2}{3}x-1\right)=18\left(\frac{1}{2}x+1\right)$$</span></p>
<p>Now continuing as we have before: <span
class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}
		20x-30&amp;=9x+18\\
		\\
		11x-30&amp;=18\\
		\\
		11x&amp;=48\\
		\\
		x&amp;=\frac{48}{11}=4.3636...
	
\end{aligned}$$</span></p>
</div>
<div id="FirstDegreeEquationsExample7" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 3.7</strong>. Solve for <span
class="math inline"><em>t</em></span>: <span
class="math display">$$\frac{1}{4}\left(\frac{3}{8}t+1\right)=\frac{2}{3}t-1$$</span></p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span> Here the lowest common denominator
is <span class="math inline">24</span>, so we multiply both sides: <span
class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}

		6\left(\frac{3}{8}t+1\right)&amp;=24\left(\frac{2}{3}t-1\right)\\
		\\
		\frac{9}{4}t+6&amp;=16t-24	
	
\end{aligned}$$</span></p>
<p>Now the fractions turn out to no be fully cleared out. So, we have to
multiply a second time, this time by <span class="math inline">4</span>
to get: <span class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}
		4\left(\frac{9}{4}t+6\right)&amp;=4\left(16t-24\right)\\	
		\\
		9t+24&amp;=64t-96
	
\end{aligned}$$</span></p>
<p>Now, with the fractions cleared, we proceed: <span
class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}
		9t+24&amp;=64t-96\\
		\\
		120&amp;=55t\\
		\\
		t&amp;=\frac{120}{55}=\frac{24}{11}=2.1818...
	
\end{aligned}$$</span></p>
</div>
<p>Clearing the fractions is optional. All of the above examples can be
done without it, just working through the algebra with fraction
arithmetic. Most people find it easier to clear the fractions instead,
but this is a matter of choice not necessity. The choice is yours.</p>
<h3 id="identities-and-contradictions">Identities and
Contradictions</h3>
<p>Not all problems can be solved! This fact of life shows up with
equations as well. Suppose you are asked to find a solution for the
equation:</p>
<p><span class="math display"><em>x</em> = <em>x</em> + 1</span></p>
<p>Without even trying any algebra on it, we can see we have a problem.
The equation says that <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> must
be equal to <span class="math inline"><em>x</em> + 1</span>. Any
solution to this equation would have to be equal to itself plus one!
That’s impossible – no number is one bigger than itself. So there is no
way that this equation could ever have a solution. Equations like this
one that have no solutions are called <strong>inconsistent</strong> or
<strong>contradictions</strong> .</p>
<p>Now, not all inconsistent equations are as transparent as this one.
For example, the equation: <span
class="math display">5(<em>x</em> − 2) + 3(<em>x</em> + 1) = 2<em>x</em> + 1 − 3(11 − 2<em>x</em>)</span></p>
<p>is also inconsistent. But while it is pretty obvious that no number
can equal itself plus one, it is not even remotely obvious that it is
impossible for five times a two less than a number plus three times one
more than that number to equal one more than twice the number less three
times eleven take away twice the number! So, how can we tell if an
equation is inconsistent?</p>
<p>Let’s see what would happen if we tried to use algebra to solve this
equation: <span class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}
	5(x-2)+3(x+1)&amp;=2x+1-3(11-2x)\\
	\\
	5x-10+3x+3&amp;=2x+1-33+6x\\
	\\
	8x-7&amp;=8x-32\\
	\\
	-7&amp;=-32
\end{aligned}$$</span></p>
<p>When we try to get the <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>’s
on one side by subtracting <span class="math inline">8<em>x</em></span>
from both sides and get an equality which is nonsense as <span
class="math inline">−7</span> is not equal to <span
class="math inline">−32</span>. And <u>that</u> is what tells us that
this equation is inconsistent. We followed the methods of algebra in
good faith, assuming that there was a solution, and those methods led us
to the absurd conclusion. So, if you believe this equation has a
solution, you then also have to believe that <span
class="math inline">−7 = −32</span>! Unless you are willing to allow
this as true, you have to conclude that the equation has no
solution.</p>
<p>The solution set of an inconsistent equation is an empty set. Since
there are no solutions, the set has no members. This set is commonly
called the <strong>empty set</strong> or the <strong>null set</strong>
and is represented with the symbol <span class="math inline">∅</span>.
Be careful not to confuse the empty set with the number <span
class="math inline">0</span>. They look similar, but they are not at all
the same thing. It is correct to say that this equation’s solution set
is <span class="math inline">∅</span>, but it is completely wrong to say
that the solution set is <span class="math inline">0</span> or to say
that <span class="math inline">0</span> is a solution to the
equation.</p>
<p>On the other hand, sometimes an equation has lots and lots of
solutions. For example, consider the equation: <span
class="math display">6<em>x</em> + 10 = 2(3<em>x</em> + 5)</span></p>
<p>It’s probably not immediately obvious that this is not an ordinary
equation, but think about what would happen if you distributed the <span
class="math inline">2</span> into the parentheses on the right. You’d
wind up with the equation: <span
class="math display">6<em>x</em> + 10 = 6<em>x</em> + 10</span></p>
<p>Now, this is true no matter what you substitute in for <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>! Any real number is a solution for
it. Equations like this are called <strong>identities</strong> . Because
any real number satisfies an identity, we say that its solution set is
the set of all real numbers, which we often indicate using the symbol
<span class="math inline">ℝ</span>.</p>
<p>Just as many inconsistent equations are not obviously so, many
identities are not obvious identities. For example, this equation is an
identity: <span
class="math display">4<em>x</em> − 2(3<em>x</em> − 5) = 7<em>x</em> − 3(3<em>x</em> − 3) + 1</span></p>
<p>but that’s not obvious at all. How can we tell?</p>
<p>Well, suppose we set out to solve this equation: <span
class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}
	4x-2(3x-5)&amp;=7x-3(3x-3)+1\\
	\\
	4x-6x+10&amp;=7x-9x+9+1\\
	\\
	-2x+10&amp;=-2x+10
\end{aligned}$$</span></p>
<p>Now, at this point we have the same expression on both sides of the
equation, which is a dead giveaway. If the two sides are the same, then
they will be equal irrespective of what <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> might be. If, though, you don’t
notice that they are the same, you could continue and add <span
class="math inline">2<em>x</em></span> to both sides and get: <span
class="math display">10 = 10</span></p>
<p>No matter what <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> is, <span
class="math inline">10</span> is equal to itself. So, this also tells us
that we have an identity on our hands!</p>
<p>(Be careful here! It is a common mistake to misread this last
equation as saying that the solution is <span
class="math inline">10</span>. This last equation does not say that
<span class="math inline"><em>x</em> = 10</span>, it says that <span
class="math inline">10 = 10</span>. That is true no matter what <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> is, which is why we conclude that
this is an identity.)</p>
<p>When given an equation to solve, it is always a possibility that the
equation may turn out to be an inconsistent equation or an identity. But
if it is, that will become apparent as you work to solve it. If it is
inconsistent, that will become apparent once the algebra leads you to an
absurd equation; if it is inconsistent that will become apparent once
the algebra leads you to an equation whose sides are both the same. If
it is an ordinary equation with a solution (called a <strong>conditional
equation</strong> ) the algebra will take you there, too.</p>
<div id="FirstDegreeEquationsExample8" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 3.8</strong>. Solve for <span
class="math inline"><em>P</em></span>: <span
class="math display">3<em>P</em> − 5(4<em>P</em> − 3) = −3(5<em>P</em> − 1) − 2<em>P</em></span></p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span> <span

		3P-20P+15&amp;=-15P+3-2P\\
		\\
		-17P+15&amp;=-17P+3\\
	
\end{aligned}$$</span></p>
<p>At this point you may notice that we have an impossible situation in
the equation, but it does no harm to continue. Adding <span
class="math inline">17<em>P</em></span> to both sides we get: <span
class="math display">15 = 3</span></p>
<p>which is clearly impossible, no matter what value we might substitute
in for <span class="math inline"><em>P</em></span>. The equation is a
contradiction; its solution set is <span
class="math inline">∅</span>.</p>

<h3 id="solving-for-one-variable-in-terms-of-others">Solving for One
Variable in Terms of Others</h3>
<p>In Section <a href="#AlgebraicSubstitution" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="AlgebraicSubstitution">1.3</a> we used the formula:
<span class="math display">$$W=210-\frac{m}{3}$$</span></p>
<p>which expresses the relationship between <span
class="math inline"><em>m</em></span>, minutes of vigorous exercise per
day, and <span class="math inline"><em>W</em></span>, a given person’s
projected weight after one year. In the examples of that section, we
substituted in values of <span class="math inline"><em>m</em></span> and
found the resulting values of <span
class="math inline"><em>W</em></span>.</p>
<p>This works great if you know the minutes of exercise and want to know
the projected weight, but what if the situation is reversed? Suppose we
have in mind a desired weight and want to know the minutes of exercise
that would be needed to achieve that. For example, suppose we want to
know the minutes of exercise needed to achieve a weight of <span
class="math inline">185</span> pounds? Well, we could substitute in
<span class="math inline"><em>W</em> = 185</span> to get the equation:
<span class="math display">$$185=210-\frac{m}{3}$$</span></p>
<p>which we could then solve for <span
class="math inline"><em>m</em></span>: <span
class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}
	185&amp;=210-\frac{m}{3} \\
	\\
	3(185) &amp;= 3 \left(210 - \frac{m}{3}\right) \\
	\\
	555 &amp;= 630 - m \\
	\\
	-75 &amp;= -m \\
	\\
	m &amp;= 75
\end{aligned}$$</span></p>
<p>So, <span class="math inline">$185=210-\frac{m}{3}$</span> implies
that <span class="math inline">75</span> minutes of daily exercise would
be required.</p>
<p>Now, that’s fine if we only need to find the minutes required for one
weight, but what if we want to be able to find the minutes required for
several different weights? It would be tedious to have to work through
essentially the same algebra over and over again. Instead, why not
rework the original equation so that it is set up to plug in <span
class="math inline"><em>W</em></span> and give <span
class="math inline"><em>m</em></span> as a result. We call this solving
for <span class="math inline"><em>m</em></span> in terms of <span
class="math inline"><em>W</em></span>.</p>
<p>The algebra principles and methods we use are essentially the same as
we’ve been using, except that instead of getting a number as a solution,
we expect the result to be a formula: <span
class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}
	W&amp;=210-\frac{m}{3} \\
	\\
	3W &amp;= 3 \left(210 - \frac{m}{3}\right) \\
	\\
	3W &amp;= 630 - m \\
	\\
	3W-630 &amp;= -m \\
	\\
	(-1)(3w-630)&amp;=(-1)(-m)\\
	\\
	-3W+630&amp;=m
\end{aligned}$$</span></p>
<p>which we can now rewrite as: <span
class="math display"><em>m</em> = −3<em>W</em> + 630 or
<em>m</em> = 630 − 3<em>W</em></span></p>
<p>It should be apparent that this new equation is set up to give values
of <span class="math inline"><em>m</em></span> readily once a value of
<span class="math inline"><em>W</em></span> is plugged in.</p>

<h2 id="SolveSecondDegree">Solving Second Degree Equations</h2>
<h3 id="the-square-root-property">The Square Root Property</h3>
<p>In order to solve a second-degree equation, or an equation with an
<span class="math inline"><em>x</em><sup>2</sup></span> term, we have to
get rid of the exponent to be able to solve for <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>. In many second-degree equations,
we can do this simply by taking the square root of both sides of the
equation. For example, to solve the following: <span
class="math display"><em>x</em><sup>2</sup> = 25</span></p>
<p>We could undo the squaring of <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> by taking the square root of both
sides. There is, though, a wrinkle in this approach. There are actually
two solutions to this equation: <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> could be <span
class="math inline">5</span> since <span
class="math inline">5<sup>2</sup> = 25</span>, but <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> could also be <span
class="math inline">−5</span> because <span
class="math inline">(−5)<sup>2</sup> = 25</span> as well. The square
root function, which is usually denoted using the radical symbol “<span
class="math inline">$\sqrt{\phantom{a}}$</span>”, is interpreted to mean
just the positive square root. Yet the positive square root is not the
only solution to the equation, and so we need to make sure we don’t
loose the other solution in the algebra. To do this we follow the
<strong>square root property</strong> which tells us that we can take
the square root of both sides of the equation so long as we acknowledge
that there are two possible square roots, the positive and the negative.
We usually do this using the symbol “<span class="math inline">±</span>”
which is read as “plus or minus”. So the next step in solving <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em><sup>2</sup> = 25</span> would be: <span
class="math display">$$x=\pm \sqrt{25}$$</span></p>
<p>leading to the solutions: <span
class="math display"><em>x</em> = ±5</span></p>
<p>It is important to understand that this notation is actually telling
us that there are two solutions to the equation. There is no such number
as <span class="math inline">±5</span>. This notation is just a compact
way of expressing that there are to the equation <span

is compact notation for the expression: <span
class="math display"><em>x</em> = 5 or <em>x</em> = −5</span></p>
<p>This method can be applied to other equations, as the following
example will illustrate:</p>
<div id="SolveSecondDegreeExample1" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 3.11</strong>. Solve <span
class="math inline">4<em>x</em><sup>2</sup> − 25 = 11</span></p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>To apply the square root property we
need to solve for <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em><sup>2</sup></span> as if it were simply a
variable. Thus, we start by adding <span class="math inline">25</span>
to both sides of the equation to obtain: <span
class="math display">4<em>x</em><sup>2</sup> = 36</span></p>
<p>and then we divide both sides by <span class="math inline">4</span>
so that: <span
class="math display"><em>x</em><sup>2</sup> = 9.</span></p>
<p>Applying the square root property now gives: <span
class="math display">$$x=\pm \sqrt{9}$$</span> <span
class="math display"><em>x</em> = ±3</span></p>
</div>
<div id="SolveSecondDegreeExample2" class="example">

<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>To do this we first use ordinary

<p>and then add <span class="math inline">9</span> to both sides: <span

<p>Now to get <span class="math inline"><em>z</em><sup>2</sup></span> by
itself we divide by 2: <span
class="math display">$$z^2=\frac{15}{2}$$</span></p>
<p>Now we are ready to use the square root property. Doing so we end up
with two solutions <span class="math display">$$z=\pm
\sqrt{\frac{15}{2}}$$</span></p>
<p>Since neither <span class="math inline">15</span> nor <span
class="math inline">2</span> is a perfect square we are stuck on
simplifying this any further. This is a perfectly fine way to express
the answer. If, however, you would like to have a decimal approximation.
it can be obtained using your calculator as <span
class="math inline"><em>z</em> = ±2.7386...</span>. The problem with
converting to a decimal is that it does typically require rounding so it
is often preferable to leave your answer in radical notation as that is
the exact answer and can be rounded to any level of precision later
on.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="factor-to-solve-a-second-degree-equation">Factor to Solve a
Second-Degree Equation</h3>
<p>In some cases, a second degree equation may be written in a way that
makes the solutions very easy to find. For example: <span
class="math display">(<em>x</em> − 4)(<em>x</em> + 1) = 0</span></p>
<p>We know that can be simplified by using the distributive property so
we know this is indeed a second degree equation.</p>
<p>We know from basic arithmetic that if you multiply two numbers
together and get zero, one of these numbers must be zero. Formally, this
fact is called the <strong>zero product property</strong>.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><strong><u>Zero Product Principle</u></strong><br />
If <span class="math inline"><em>A</em><em>B</em> = 0</span>, then
either <span class="math inline"><em>A</em> = 0</span> or <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em> = 0</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>Now, in this equation we have two expressions being multiplied
together: <span class="math inline"><em>x</em> − 4</span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em> + 1</span>. The equation says that their
product is zero. So, according to the zero product property, the only
possibilities are <span class="math display"><em>x</em> − 4 = 0 or
<em>x</em> + 1 = 0</span></p>
<p>Using this fact we know there are two possibilities to consider. One
is that <span class="math inline"><em>x</em> − 4 = 0</span>. If that is
the case, then we can easily solve and see that <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em> = 4</span>. The other possibility is that
<span class="math inline"><em>x</em> + 1 = 0</span>. In that case, we
can also easily solve and see that <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em> = −1</span>. So, we conclude that this
equation’s solutions are <span class="math inline"><em>x</em> = 4</span>
and <span class="math inline"><em>x</em> = −1</span>. When a second
degree equation is written in a form like this, as a product, we can
find the solutions simply by setting each of the factors equal to zero
and solving. Here is another example:</p>
<div id="SolveSecondDegreeExample4" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 3.14</strong>. Solve: <span
class="math inline">5(2<em>x</em> − 3)(<em>x</em> + 7) = 0</span></p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>To solve <span
class="math inline">5(2<em>x</em> − 3)(<em>x</em> + 7) = 0</span> we set
each factor equal to zero and determine if that leads to a consistent
equation. Since the product is zero, we can apply the zero product
principle to conclude that either <span class="math inline">5 = 0</span>
or <span class="math inline">2<em>x</em> − 3 = 0</span> or <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em> + 7 = 0</span>. Since the first factor is
a number and it is not equal to zero, we get a contradiction as <span
class="math inline">5 ≠ 0</span>. Thus, the first factor does not lead
to a solution to the equation in question. The second factor, <span
class="math inline">2<em>x</em> − 3</span> is zero when <span
class="math inline">$x=\frac{3}{2}$</span>. The third factor <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em> + 7</span> is zero when <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em> = −7</span>. Thus, there are two
solutions to the equation <span
class="math inline">$x=\frac{3}{2}$</span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em> = −7</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>As we saw in section <a href="#SecondDegreeFactor"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="SecondDegreeFactor">2.6</a>
this second-degree equation is written as the product of expressions, or
we can say in factored form. In some cases, we can use the method given
to us in section <a href="#SecondDegreeFactor" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="SecondDegreeFactor">2.6</a> to factor the second degree
expression to help us solve. To review:</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><strong><u>Factoring Second Degree Expressions of the Form <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em><sup>2</sup> + <em>b</em><em>x</em> + <em>c</em></span></u></strong><br />

<ol>
<li><p>Consider all the pairs of integers whose product is <span
class="math inline"><em>c</em></span></p></li>
<li><p>If the sum of any of the pairs is <span
class="math inline"><em>b</em></span>, then the expression can be
factored to <span
class="math inline">(<em>x</em> + <em>m</em>)(<em>x</em> + <em>n</em>)</span>
where <span class="math inline"><em>m</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> are the integers.</p></li>
<li><p>If none of the pairs sum to <span
class="math inline"><em>b</em></span>, then the expression cannot be
factored using integers. We then say is it “not factorable over the
integers”.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>When groupings of the same variable raised to power or exponents, you
can just add the exponents<br />
(make sure to remember that a ‘plain’ <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> is actually <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em><sup>1</sup></span>). <span
class="math display"><em>x</em><sup><em>a</em></sup> ⋅ <em>x</em><sup><em>b</em></sup> = <em>x</em><sup><em>a</em> + <em>b</em></sup></span></p>
</div>
<div id="SolveSecondDegreeExample5" class="example">

</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>We need to consider all possible
pairs of integers whose product is <span class="math inline">6</span>
and then look at their sum to see if it is possible to obtain a sum of
the factors equal to <span class="math inline">−5</span>. We consider
all possible pairs <span class="math inline">1</span> and <span
class="math inline">6</span> (sum <span class="math inline">7</span>),
<span class="math inline">−1</span> and <span

class="math inline"><em>x</em><sup>2</sup> − 5<em>x</em> + 6 = (<em>x</em> − 2)(<em>x</em> − 3)</span></p>
</div>
<p>In this case, there were not many possibilities to consider, and one
of those possibilities worked. In many cases, though, there are either
too many possible pairs to consider, or the expression can’t be factored
over the integers at all. In the special case where the expression can
be readily factored, solving by factoring is a reasonable method to
use.</p>

<h2 id="SolveHigherOrderEquations">Solving Equations of Degree 2 or
Greater</h2>
<p>The following exercises will contain concepts covered in chapters 1
(use of the balance principal), chapter 2 (some exponent properties) and
the previous section, solving second degree equations. As you may have
picked up on, solving an equation of any degree still makes use of the
balance principal, manipulating the equation to isolate the variable. As
you saw in the previous section, when we had a second degree equation,
one option is to use the square root property. Recall this example:
<span class="math display"><em>x</em><sup>2</sup> = 25</span></p>
<p>We wanted to isolate that <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>, and in order to do so we needed
to “undo” that power of <span class="math inline">2</span>. Our method
was to take the square root of the left side and subsequently the right
side as well to do so: <span class="math display">$$\sqrt{x^2} =
\sqrt{25}$$</span></p>
<p>leading to: <span class="math inline"><em>x</em> = ±5</span>.</p>
<h3 id="rational-exponents">Rational Exponents</h3>
<p>We are now going to consider what happens in such a situation where
the exponent on the variable is larger than <span
class="math inline">2</span>. Everything above is based on the fact that
the square root of a number, (<span
class="math inline">$\sqrt(k)$</span>), gives us a solution to <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em><sup>2</sup> = <em>k</em></span>. We need
to explore this in more detail.</p>
<p>Since <span class="math inline">$\sqrt{16} = 4$</span>, the phrase
square root literally comes from the area of a square. A square with
side lengths of <span class="math inline">4</span>cm has an area of
<span class="math inline">16cm<sup>2</sup></span>. If we are being
completely formal, we’d write the expression <span
class="math inline">$\sqrt{16}$</span> like this: <span
class="math display">$$\sqrt{16}=\sqrt[2]{16^1}$$</span></p>
<p>The “2” on the outside of the radical is called the
<strong>index</strong>. As a matter of efficiency, humans stopped
writing this index of <span class="math inline">2</span> with square
roots because we use them so frequently. The “<span
class="math inline">1</span>” on the inside, with the base of <span
class="math inline">16</span>, is still called the
<strong>exponent</strong> or <strong>power</strong>. We can further
rewrite the expression like this: <span
class="math display">$$\sqrt{16}=\sqrt[2]{16^1}=16^{\frac{1}{2}}$$</span></p>
<p>Unique. Check your calculator to see the expressions are actually
equivalent. <span class="math inline">$16^{\frac{1}{2}}$</span> can be
entered into your calculator as “<span
class="math inline">16<sup>∧</sup>(1/2)</span>”.</p>
<p>So, what does the expression <span
class="math inline">$\sqrt[3]{27}$</span> represent? We read this as the
“cube root of <span class="math inline">27</span>” or as the “third root
of <span class="math inline">27</span>”. It can be rewritten as: <span
class="math display">$$\sqrt[3]{27} = \sqrt[3]{27^1} =
27^{\frac{1}{3}}$$</span></p>
<p>Evaluating this last expression using your calculator yields <span
class="math inline">3</span>. Why? Because <span
class="math inline">3 ⋅ 3 ⋅ 3 = 27</span>.</p>

<h2 id="solving-using-rational-exponents">Solving using Rational
Exponents</h2>
<p>Relating equations to this exponent rule will give us another
perspective as to why it is meaningful. Remember that there is a
connection between radicals and fractional exponents. If we look at the
same equation, <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em><sup>2</sup> = 25</span>, we started the
section with again we can rationalize the steps in another way. Remember
the idea is to isolate the variable. When we solved this equation above,
we resulted with just <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> on the
left side. The power on that “isolated” <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> is 1. If we recall the power rule
for exponents given to us in section <a
href="#AlgebraicExpressionsExponents" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="AlgebraicExpressionsExponents">2.3</a>, where <span
class="math inline">(<em>x</em><sup><em>a</em></sup>)<sup><em>b</em></sup> = <em>x</em><sup><em>a</em> ⋅ <em>b</em></sup></span>,
we can use this rule to help us solve. <span
class="math display"><em>x</em><sup>2</sup> = 25</span></p>
<p>We want to raise both sides to some power such that when we multiply
that power by the power of <span class="math inline">2</span> that
exists on the left side currently, the result is <span
class="math inline">1</span>. In other words, “<span
class="math inline">2</span> times what number gives us <span
class="math inline">1</span>”? <span class="math inline">$2 \cdot
\frac{1}{2} = 1$</span> as <span class="math inline">$2 \cdot
\frac{1}{2} = \frac{2}{1} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{2}{2}= 1$</span>.
Multiplying a number by its reciprocal will always yield <span
class="math inline">1</span>!</p>
<p>So, if we raise both sides to the <span
class="math inline">$\frac{1}{2}$</span> power, we have the following:
<span class="math display">$${(x^2)}^{\frac{1}{2}} =
(25)^{\frac{1}{2}}$$</span></p>
<p>Using the power rule: <span class="math display">$$x^{2 \cdot
\frac{1}{2}} = 25^{\frac{1}{2}}$$</span> <span
class="math display"><em>x</em> = ±5</span></p>
<p>We end up with the same solution, because raising both sides to the
<span class="math inline">$\frac{1}{2}$</span> power is the same as
taking the square root!</p>
<p>Let’s look at another example:</p>
<div id="SolveHigherOrderEquationsExample4" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 3.22</strong>. Solve <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em><sup>3</sup> = 64</span></p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span> We want to isolate that variable on
the left side and it is being raised to the third power. We need to
think what can I multiply <span class="math inline">3</span> by to give
me <span class="math inline">1</span>? <span class="math inline">$3
\cdot \frac{1}{3} = 1$</span>! Let’s take this approach: <span
class="math display">$$\left({x^3}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}}=64^{\frac{1}{3}}$$</span></p>
<p>Using the power rule: <span
class="math display">$$x^{3\cdot\frac{1}{3}}=64^{\frac{1}{3}}$$</span></p>
<p>Remember that <span class="math inline">$64^{\frac{1}{3}}$</span> can
be entered into the calculator as “<span
class="math inline">64<sup>∧</sup>(1/3)</span>” and we get: <span
class="math display"><em>x</em><sup>1</sup> = <em>x</em> = 4</span></p>
</div>
<p>It is important to realize that because <span
class="math inline">$x^{\frac{1}{3}}=\sqrt[3]{x}$</span>, taking the
cube or third root of both sides would have given us the same
solution!</p>
<h3 id="one-solution-or-multiple-solutions">One Solution or Multiple
Solutions</h3>
<p>Another thing to note here is we have one strict solution in this
particular case, whereas in the previous equation <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em><sup>2</sup> = 5</span> we knew that we
had <span class="math inline">2</span> solutions, <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em> = 5</span> or <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em> = −5</span>. In the case of an even power
squaring a positive or a negative, results in the same solution: <span
class="math display">(3)<sup>2</sup> = 9 and
(−3)<sup>2</sup> = 9</span></p>
<p>We can say the same for a number raised to the fourth power (an any
even power): <span
class="math display">(2)<sup>4</sup> = 2 ⋅ 2 ⋅ 2 ⋅ 2 = 16 and
(−2)<sup>4</sup> = (−2) ⋅ (−2) ⋅ (−2) ⋅ (−2) = 16</span></p>
<p>When there is an even number of negatives, the result will always be
positive! When we are working with an odd power, we do not yield the
same results: <span class="math display">(2)<sup>3</sup> = 2 ⋅ 2 ⋅ 2 = 8
and (−2)<sup>3</sup> = (−2) ⋅ (−2) ⋅ (−2) = −8</span></p>
<p>The multiplication of the first two numbers gives us a positive <span
class="math inline">4</span>, but then we have a positive <span
class="math inline">4</span> times a negative <span
class="math inline">2</span>, which leaves us with a negative <span
class="math inline">8</span>. So, going back to our example above, <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em><sup>3</sup> = 64</span>, <span
class="math inline">4</span> is the unique solution to that equation
because if we tried to test our equation with a <span
class="math inline">−4</span>: <span
class="math display">(−4) ⋅ (−4) ⋅ (−4) = −64</span></p>
<div id="SolveHigherOrderEquationsExample5" class="example">

</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>Let’s look at this equation very
carefully. The left side reads “two times <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> to the third power”. We absolutely
want to use the balance principal to help us isolate that <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>, but it is important to realize
that only the variable is being raised to the third power, not the
coefficient out front. For that reason, we need to start here first
before we worry about that power. We take the same steps we would take
if we had an <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> with a power of
<span class="math inline">1</span> on the left side. If we are
multiplying, we transform this equation using division: <span
class="math display">2<em>x</em><sup>3</sup> = 128</span></p>
<p>Divide by <span class="math inline">2</span> on both sides to begin:
<span class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}

	\\
	x^3 &amp;= 64\\

<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span> Thinking of this equation where the

<h1 id="foundations-of-functions">Foundations of Functions</h1>
<h2 id="Functions">Functions</h2>
<p>One of the biggest uses of algebra (and mathematics in general) is
describing and modeling the relationship between two related quantities.
For example, we might want to:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>find the amount of grass seed we need to cover an athletic field
based on its size, or</p></li>
<li><p>calculate the equivalent temperature in Fahrenheit for a
temperature in Celsius, or</p></li>
<li><p>price a vacation package based on the number of nights we want to
stay, or</p></li>
<li><p>estimate when we will arrive at our destination from how many
miles we have left to travel, or</p></li>
<li><p>determine the grade needed on a final exam to achieve a desired
final course grade</p></li>
</ol>
<p>and we could easily come up with many, many more examples. In this
chapter, we’ll develop techniques that will be useful in handling these
sorts of situations.<br />
Even though these examples deal with unrelated things, they all have
something in common. Each involves a relationship between two
quantities, and in each we have in mind that we will know the value (or
values) we want to consider for one of the quantities (the Celsius
temperature, the field size, the number of nights, the distance left to
travel, or the desired grade), and we will want to find the value(s) of
the other quantity as a result. You might have several athletic fields
to seed, and need to figure out how much grass seed you need to take to
each one to complete the job. Or you might be taking a trip to Canada,
where temperatures are given in Celsius, and want to have a way to
convert them to more familiar Fahrenheit temperatures.<br />
These situations all fit nicely into a general framework called a
function. In this chapter, we will introduce functions, and show how
they can be used in these and other situations.</p>
<h3 id="functions">Functions</h3>
<p>We’ll start by defining functions and related terms. This all may
seem overwhelming at first, but don’t worry – it should make more sense
after looking at a few examples.<br />
</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><strong><u>Function Definition</u></strong><br />
</p>
<p>A function is a rule which processes information by assigning one and
only one output to each input. If the input variable’s name is <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>, the output variable is <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em></span>, and the name of the function is
<span class="math inline"><em>f</em></span>, we write <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em> = <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>)</span> which is
read as “<span class="math inline"><em>y</em></span> equals <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em></span> of <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>.” (Other letters can be used for
any of the quantities involved, but whatever letters are used they
follow the same pattern.)<br />
Functions can be represented using a function diagram like this:<br />
<span class="math display">$$input \rightarrow \boxed{f} \rightarrow
output$$</span></p>
<p>or using variables:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$x \rightarrow \boxed{f} \rightarrow y
\text{  OR  } x \rightarrow \boxed{f} \rightarrow f(x)$$</span></p>
<p>When a function exists between two quantities, we say that “the
output variable (or quantity) is a function of the input variable (or
quantity).”</p>
</div>
<p>Perfectly clear? Probably not – that’s a lot of terminology to absorb
all at once. With practice, though, these terms will become familiar.
Let’s take a look at a couple of examples to illustrate how it all
works.</p>
<div id="FunctionsExample1" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 4.1</strong>. The amount of grass seed (in pounds)
needed to cover an athletic field can be determined based on the area
(in square feet). Let <span class="math inline"><em>y</em></span>
represent the amount of grass seed and let <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> represent the area.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>State the input variable and quantity.</p></li>
<li><p>State the output variable and quantity.</p></li>
<li><p>Describe the relationship by stating “ is a function of ” using
both the variables and the quantities they represent.</p></li>
<li><p>Assuming the function’s name is <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em></span>, write an equation which relates
the variables and the function.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span></p>
<ol>
<li><p>The relationship described here says that we are going to
determine the amount of seed based on the area. The question does not
say we need to draw a function diagram, but it may be helpful to do
this. It seems that we are meant to “tell” the function the area we need
to cover, and then “ask” the function to then determine how much grass
seed we need. So the function diagram would look like this:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$area \rightarrow \boxed{f} \rightarrow
grass \text{ } seed$$</span></p>
<p>and from this diagram it is clear that the input quantity is area (in
square feet) and the input variable is <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span>.</p></li>
<li><p>From the diagram we can see that the output quantity is pounds of
grass seed, and the output variable is <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em></span>.</p></li>
<li><p>The phrasing always follows the patters “output is a function of
input”. So, using quantities, we would say that “the amount of grass
seed, <span class="math inline"><em>y</em></span>, is a function of the
area, <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span>”.</p></li>
<li><p>Following the pattern used in the definition, we would write
<span
class="math inline"><em>y</em> = <em>f</em>(<em>A</em>)</span>.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>A function can be imagined as a kind of computer, programmed to
process just the information we want. The function diagrams can help
with that. In the example we just saw, the description clearly indicated
that we’d need something we could tell the area of the field and then
have it figure out and tell us how much grass seed we’d need. Drawing a
diagram to reflect this flow of information makes it clear which is the
input and which is the output, and then following the definitions
everything else just falls into place. With practice, you may not need
to draw diagrams or look back at definitions. But until you’ve reached
the point where this is all second nature, it’s a good idea to follow
the method shown in the example.</p>
<div id="FunctionsExample2" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 4.2</strong>. The Fahrenheit temperature <span
class="math inline"><em>F</em></span> can be calculated for any
temperature in Celsius, <span class="math inline"><em>C</em></span>. Let
the function which calculates this be called <span
class="math inline"><em>T</em></span>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>State the input variable and quantity.</p></li>
<li><p>State the output variable and quantity.</p></li>
<li><p>Describe the function using “<u><span
class="math inline">$\phantom{blank}$</span></u> is a function of
<u><span class="math inline">$\phantom{blank}$</span></u>” using the
variables and the quantities they represent.</p></li>
<li><p>Write an equation which relates the variables and the
function.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span> The problem states that we want to
determine Fahrenheit for a given Celsius temperature. So we want our
function to do this:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$C \rightarrow \boxed{T} \rightarrow
F$$</span></p>
<ol>
<li><p>The input quantity is degrees Celsius, and the input variable is
<span class="math inline"><em>C</em></span></p></li>
<li><p>The output quantity is degrees Fahrenheit and the output variable
is <span class="math inline"><em>F</em></span></p></li>
<li><p>It’s always “<u>output</u> is a function of <u>input</u>”, so we
would say<br />
“the Fahrenheit temperature, <span
class="math inline"><em>F</em></span>, is a function of the Celsius
temperature, <span class="math inline"><em>C</em></span>”.<br />
</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>In this example Celsius is the input and Fahrenheit is the output.
Could it be the other way around? Well, with Fahrenheit and Celsius
temperatures at least, sure it could. We could figure out Celsius based
on Fahrenheit just as well as Fahrenheit based on Celsius. Which is
input and which is output is determined by what we are trying to do. The
description of this problem made it clear that in this case we want to
determine Fahrenheit for a given Celsius temperature, and that’s why we
set our function up that way. You have to read carefully to determine
input and output – be careful!</p>
<h3 id="functions-and-formulas">Functions and Formulas</h3>
<p>Now, in what we’ve done so far, we’ve been able to determine the
setup of the input-output function relationship and describe it in
appropriate terminology, but we haven’t had enough information to
actually find the correct output for any particular input value. To do
that, we need to know the details of the function’s rule.<br />
The most common way to give a function’s rule is with a formula. A
simple example will illustrate. Suppose we want to set up a function to
find the area <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> of a square
based on the length of its side, <span
class="math inline"><em>s</em></span>. This function would take side
length as its input, and give area as its output. So we would say that
area is a function of side length, or <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em></span> is a function of <span
class="math inline"><em>s</em></span>. If we name the function <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em></span>, we could write <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em> = <em>f</em>(<em>s</em>)</span>.<br />
But we can go further. We know how to calculate the area of a square
based on its side length. Using our variables, we can write the formula
for the area of a square as</p>
<p><span
class="math display"><em>A</em> = <em>s</em><sup>2</sup></span></p>
<p>or, replacing the output variable with <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>s</em>)</span> we could write this
formula as</p>
<p><span
class="math display"><em>f</em>(<em>s</em>) = <em>s</em><sup>2</sup>.</span></p>
<p>We’ve taken the formula for the area of a square and used it to write
a formula for the function which finds the area of a square. For any
given input value of <span class="math inline"><em>s</em></span>, this
formula tells you that the output value you want can be found by using
that value in the formula <span
class="math inline"><em>s</em><sup>2</sup></span>.<br />
In other words, once we have this formula for the function, we can find
the output for any input by algebraic substitution into a formula. For
example, suppose we want to find the area of a square whose length is
<span class="math inline">10</span> inches. We would then use <span
class="math inline"><em>s</em> = 10</span> in our formula to get:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}
	&amp; f(s)=s^2
	&amp; f(10)=10^2
	&amp; f(10)=100
\end{aligned}$$</span></p>
<p>Not surprisingly the formula tells us the area would be <span
class="math inline">100</span> square inches.<br />
Before we move on, notice that we substituted for <span
class="math inline"><em>s</em></span> both in the formula itself and
also inside the “<span class="math inline">$f(\phantom{s})$</span>.”
This left us with the expression “<span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(10)</span>” on the left side. This will
happen whenever we replace the input variable with a specific value. So
wherever we might run into the expression “<span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(10)</span>” we would understand that to
mean “the specific output you get from the function <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em></span> with the input <span
class="math inline">10</span>”. A shorter way of saying that is “<span
class="math inline"><em>f</em></span> of <span
class="math inline">10</span>”. Likewise, we would read “<span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(5.3)</span>” as “<span
class="math inline"><em>f</em></span> of <span
class="math inline">5.3</span>” and would understand that to mean the
output you get from the function <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em></span> if you input the value <span
class="math inline">5.3</span>.</p>
<div id="FunctionsExample3" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 4.3</strong>. The Fahrenheit temperature <span
class="math inline"><em>F</em></span> is a function of the Celsius
temperature <span class="math inline"><em>C</em></span>. The formula for
this function is given by <span
class="math inline">$T(C)=\frac{9}{5}C+32$</span>. Use this function
formula to find the Fahrenheit temperature equivalent to <span
class="math inline">30<sup>∘</sup><em>C</em></span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span> We need to use <span
class="math inline"><em>C</em> = 30</span> in the formula. We get:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}
		T(C)&amp;=\frac{9}{5}C+32\\
		\\
		T(30)&amp;=\frac{9}{5}(30)+32\\
		&amp;=86
	
\end{aligned}$$</span></p>
<p>So the Fahrenheit temperature corresponding to <span
class="math inline">30<sup>∘</sup><em>C</em></span> would be <span
class="math inline">86<sup>∘</sup><em>F</em></span>.<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>Of course it is nice to know the purpose of a function, but if all we
have is a formula we can still calculate outputs for inputs just the
same.</p>
<div id="FunctionsExample4" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 4.4</strong>. Suppose <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = <em>x</em><sup>2</sup> − 3<em>x</em> + 1</span>.
Find <span class="math inline"><em>f</em>(−2)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span> <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(−2)</span> is the result of using <span
class="math inline">−2</span> as an input into this function. So:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}
		f(x)&amp;=x^2-3x+1\\
		\\
		f(-2)&amp;=(-2)^2-3(-2)+1\\
		&amp;=4+6+1\\
		&amp;=11
	
\end{aligned}$$</span></p>
</div>
<h3 id="functions-defined-verbally">Functions Defined Verbally</h3>
<p>Formulas are a very handy way to state a function’s rule. But having
a formula is not required. To have a function, you must have one and
only one output for each input. The way you get that input may be
specified by a formula, but it can be expressed in other ways. One of
these other ways is a verbal description of the rule.</p>
<div id="FunctionsExample5" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 4.5</strong>. The sales tax rate in Ontario County,
NY is <span class="math inline">7.5%</span>. Let <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>t</em>)</span> be the total price
including tax for a purchase of <span
class="math inline"><em>t</em></span> dollars. Find <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(800)</span>, the price including sales
tax for a laptop priced at <span class="math inline">$800</span>.
Express your answer both as an answer to the question and in function
notation.</p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span> The sales tax is <span
class="math inline">7.5%</span> of <span class="math inline">$800</span>
which would be <span class="math inline">(0.075)($800) = $60</span>. So
the total price would be <span
class="math inline">$800 + $60 = $860</span>. So, in answer to the
question, the price including tax is <span
class="math inline">$860</span>. In function notation we would write
<span class="math inline"><em>f</em>(800) = 860</span>.<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>Here, we didn’t have a formula, but we had enough information to
calculate the output, nonetheless. If we wanted to, we could come up
with a formula for this function. It is not too hard to see that this
function could also be given as <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>t</em>) = .075<em>t</em> + <em>t</em></span>.
Sometimes, though, we may have a function for which a formula would be
utterly impossible.</p>
<div id="FunctionsExample6" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 4.6</strong>. Suppose <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em></span> is the rule which assigns to each

<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span> The function takes states as inputs

ever write an algebraic formula to “calculate” this. But, we can still
determine the output for a given input. If you don’t happen to know the
state capital of Washington, a few moments with an atlas or surfing the
web reveals that <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>W</em><em>a</em><em>s</em><em>h</em><em>i</em><em>n</em><em>g</em><em>t</em><em>o</em><em>n</em>) = <em>O</em><em>l</em><em>y</em><em>m</em><em>p</em><em>i</em><em>a</em></span>.<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>The state capital example reveals something else about functions:
they don’t necessarily have to involve numbers or quantities. Other
pieces of information, such as states or their capitals, can be used as
the inputs and outputs for a function. In mathematics, we are usually
most interested in functions with numerical inputs and outputs – and
most of the functions we’ll see in this class will be numeric ones. But
non-numeric functions like this are nonetheless perfectly good
functions.</p>
<h3 id="functions-defined-by-tables">Functions Defined by Tables</h3>
<p>Sometimes neither a formula nor a verbal description is available to
give a function’s rule. Functions can also be defined using a table
which lists inputs and gives their corresponding outputs. We don’t need
to know what the rationale (if any) was for assigning any particular
input its output – we only need to be able to determine what the output
is.<br />
One common example of a table-defined function might be US Social
Security numbers. Each US citizen has one and only one Social Security
number, and so we can look at Social Security numbers as a function of
US citizens. There is no way to possibly define any algebraic formula
for this function, nor is there any way to verbally describe a rule that
would let you figure out someone’s Social Security number based on who
they are (if you ever did find such a rule, you could make a fortune in
identity theft.) The only way to specify that function would be by
listing out every citizen and his or her number. This would be
impractical to do on paper, but it is not hard to imagine that a
computer could contain this information in a massive table. In fact, the
Social Security Administration has such a table in their computer
systems.<br />
Here is a more modest example of a table-defined function.</p>
<div id="FunctionsExample7" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 4.7</strong>. Let <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>s</em>)</span> be the fine in
Pennsylvania for speeding in a <span
class="math inline">65<em>m</em><em>p</em><em>h</em></span> zone. A
highway road sign shows the fine for speeding as a function of how fast
you were going.</p>
<div class="center">

the fine is <span class="math inline">$65</span>. In function notation
we would write <span

</p>
</div>
<p>A word of warning about table-defined functions. Unless you have
extra information about how the function’s outputs are determined, you
cannot use a table to find outputs for any inputs that are not listed in
the table. Table-defined functions are limited to only the inputs listed
in the table.<br />
For example, suppose you want to know the fine for going <span
class="math inline">90</span> mph. There is no way to tell this from the
given table. It seems that for every <span class="math inline">5</span>
mph increase in speed the fine goes up <span
class="math inline">$10</span>, so it might be reasonable to guess the
fine would be <span class="math inline">$85</span>. But that is only a
guess. It could also be that the maximum fine for speeding is <span
class="math inline">$75</span>, so that might be the fine for a <span
class="math inline">90</span> mph speed. Or, maybe the state has an
extra fine tacked on for really excessive speeds, making the fine for
<span class="math inline">90</span> mph <span
class="math inline">$100</span>, or <span
class="math inline">$150</span>, or <span
class="math inline">$250</span>? There just is no way of knowing for
sure. Based on this table, you cannot determine the fine for a <span
class="math inline">90<em>m</em><em>p</em><em>h</em></span> speed. But
really you shouldn’t be driving that fast anyway.</p>
<h3 id="domain-and-range">Domain and Range</h3>
<p>We’ve defined a function to be any rule that takes inputs, processes
them according to some rule, and then gives outputs as a result. We
haven’t said much, though, about what sorts of things we can use as
inputs or get as outputs from our functions. For a given function, some
things would make sense as inputs, and some things would not. In Example
<a href="#FunctionsExample6" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="FunctionsExample6">4.6</a> (the state capitals function)
it would make sense to use “Washington”, “Nebraska”, or “Rhode Island”
as inputs, since these are all states. But it wouldn’t make any sense at
all to input the “Pacific Ocean”, the number <span
class="math inline">8</span>, or “Justin Bieber” into that function –
none of these are states, and so asking what the state capital of the
Pacific Ocean, 8, or the Bieb wouldn’t make any sense.<br />
On the other hand, for the function <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = <em>x</em><sup>2</sup> − 3<em>x</em> + 1</span>
which we used in Example <a href="#FunctionsExample4"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="FunctionsExample4">4.4</a> it
makes perfect sense to input the number 8, but “Washington”, “Nebraska”
or “Rhode Island” don’t make any more sense as inputs than an ocean or a
teen idol.<br />
Every function has a certain set of things that it can take as inputs,
and also a set of things that can show up as outputs. These are called
the domain and range respectively. They’re important enough to deserve a
highlighted definition:<br />
</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><strong><u>Domain and Range</u></strong><br />
The set of all possible inputs for a function is called its
<strong>domain</strong>. The set of all possible outputs for a function
is called its <strong>range</strong>.</p>
</div>
<p>For a function like the state capitals function, determining the
domain and range is a matter of asking yourself what sorts of things the
described function is intended to take as inputs, and what the relevant
outputs would be. For the state capitals example, the domain is the set
of all U.S. states. More formally we could write this as <span
class="math inline">{<em>x</em>|<em>x</em> is a U.S. State}</span>. The
range would be the set of all U.S. state capitals; formally <span
class="math inline">{<em>y</em>|<em>y</em> is a U.S. state
capital}</span>. Note that the letters used in the formal set
descriptions don’t matter – the domain could also have been written
<span class="math inline">{<em>t</em>|<em>t</em> is a U.S. State}</span>
or using any other letter. (You should ask your instructor whether or
not you are expected to write domains and ranges in formal set-builder
notation or can just give a verbal description.)</p>
<div id="FunctionsExample8" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 4.8</strong>. Let <span
class="math inline"><em>c</em>(<em>t</em>)</span> be the rule that tells
what day of the week each human being <span
class="math inline"><em>t</em></span> was born on. What are the domain
and range of this function?</p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span> This function takes as inputs human
beings. So the domain would be the set of all human beings, or <span
class="math inline">{<em>t</em>|<em>t</em> is a human
being}</span>.<br />
</p>
<p>The outputs from this function are days of the week. So the domain
would be the set of days of the week, or <span
class="math inline">{<em>y</em>|<em>y</em> is a day of the week}</span>,
or <span class="math inline">{</span>Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
Thursday, Friday, Saturday<span class="math inline">}</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>For a numerical function like <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = <em>x</em><sup>2</sup> − 3<em>x</em> + 1</span>
the domain would be the set of all real numbers, or <span
class="math inline">ℝ</span>, since any real number could be substituted
into the formula and give a result. The range for this function is a
more complicated question. While the outputs from this function will
obviously be real numbers, it’s not obvious whether every real number
actually does end up as an output from this function. In fact, it turns
out that there are lots of real numbers that cannot possibly be output
from this function. For example, no matter what you input for <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> you will never get <span
class="math inline">−5</span> out of this function (take our word for
that for now, though you’ll see how we know this can never happen later
in the course.) So, the range is not the set of all real numbers. At
this point in the course we are not ready to determine just what the
range of this function is, so we will avoid questions about the ranges
of functions like this one for now (we’ll revisit this question
later.)</p>
<div id="FunctionsExample9" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 4.9</strong>. What is the domain of the function
<span class="math inline">$g(z)=2z+\frac{z^2}{5}$</span>?</p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span> Any real number could be substituted
in to this formula and give a result. So the domain is <span
class="math inline">ℝ</span>, the set of all real numbers.<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>Sometimes there are real numbers that cannot be substituted in to a
formula to give an output. For example, the function <span
class="math inline">$h(x)=\frac{1}{x}$</span> cannot have the number
<span class="math inline">0</span> in its domain, because if you
substitute zero into the formula you get <span
class="math inline">$\frac{1}{0}$</span> which is undefined. Any other
real number, though, would be fine. So the domain of this function is
all nonzero real numbers, or <span
class="math inline">{<em>x</em>|<em>x</em> ≠ 0}</span>.<br />
At this point in your mathematical career, you know about two
impossibilities. You cannot divide by zero, and you cannot take the
square root of a negative number. So, if a function’s rule asks you to
divide by or take the square root of anything involving the input
variable, we need to make sure to exclude from its domain any values
that would require doing the impossible.</p>
<div id="FunctionsExample10" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 4.10</strong>. What is the domain of the function
<span class="math inline">$f(x)=\frac{3x^2 -5x+73}{x-3}$</span>?</p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span> The numerator looks intimidating,
but it doesn’t matter to us. Nothing impossible will happen in the
numerator, no matter what value of <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> you input. On the other hand, we
must make sure that the denominator is never zero. So, to find the value
we need to exclude from the domain, we solve the equation <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em> − 3 = 0</span> and get <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em> = 3</span>. So since <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em> = 3</span> would give us a zero
denominator, we must exclude it from the domain. So the domain is all
real numbers except 3, or <span
class="math inline">{<em>x</em>|<em>x</em> ≠ 3}</span>.<br />
</p>
</div>
<div id="FunctionsExample11" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 4.11</strong>. What is the domain of the function
<span class="math inline">$g(x)=\sqrt{3x-2}$</span>?</p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span> Here we need to make sure that the
expression in the square root is not negative, or, in other words, that
it is greater than or equal to zero. So we solve <span
class="math inline">3<em>x</em> − 2 ≥ 0</span> and get that <span
class="math inline">$x \ge \frac{2}{3}$</span>. So our domain is all
real numbers greater than or equal to <span
class="math inline">$\frac{2}{3}$</span>, or <span
class="math inline">$\{ x \vert x \ge \frac{2}{3} \}$</span>, or <span
class="math inline">[2, ∞)</span>.<br />
</p>
</div>
<h3 id="determining-whether-or-not-a-rule-is-a-function">Determining
Whether or Not a Rule is a Function</h3>
<p>Not every rule is a function. When we have a function, we demand that
it provide us a clear and unambiguous output for any input we give it.
If I input the length of a square’s side, I want to know the area. I
don’t want a list of several different possible areas. If I know the
Celsius temperature is <span
class="math inline">10<sup>∘</sup><em>C</em></span> and want to convert
that to Fahrenheit, I want one and only one answer to that question. I
don’t want to be told, “well, it might be <span
class="math inline">50<sup>∘</sup><em>F</em></span>, or it might be
<span class="math inline">84<sup>∘</sup><em>F</em></span>, or it might
be twenty below.”<br />
Our definition of a function requires that for each input we get one and
only one output. A function isn’t allowed to hedge. Functions have to
always give a straight answer! So, a rule that does not do this can’t be
a function.<br />
How could a rule not meet this requirement? Well, just about any
algebraic formula can be used to define a function. We know from
experience that the basic mathematical operations always evaluate to the
same result. (Six times nine is fifty-four, it was fifty-four yesterday,
it will be fifty-four tomorrow, it is fifty-four in New York, it is
fifty-four in China, it is always always always always fifty-four.) So
we know that <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = 5<em>x</em><sup>3</sup> − 7<em>x</em><sup>2</sup> − 3<em>x</em> − 9</span>
is a perfectly good function, because no matter what input we substitute
in for <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>, the process of
evaluating the result will always give one and only one final answer,
and whatever that answer is it will be the same anytime, anywhere.<br />
But not all rules behave this way. Sometimes, though, we try to set up a
function and end up with a rule that can give more than one output for a
given input. The following examples will illustrate a few cases where
this may be a problem.</p>
<div id="FunctionsExample12" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 4.12</strong>. Let <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em>(<em>c</em>)</span> be the rule that tells
you the current NHL hockey team for each location that is the named home
of a current NHL team. Does this rule define a function?</p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span> This rule is set up to process
information, taking homes of NHL teams as inputs and giving the teams
themselves as outputs:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$\text{home} \rightarrow \boxed{h}
\rightarrow \text{team}$$</span></p>
<p>Now for many locations this works fine. For example:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$\text{Buffalo} \rightarrow \boxed{h}
\rightarrow \text{Sabres}$$</span></p>
<p>and similarly if we input Boston, Toronto, or Montreal things work
out fine; we get the Bruins, the Leafs, and the Canadiens as outputs
respectively.<br />
</p>
<p>But we run into a problem if we input New York. There are two NHL
teams that call New York home: the Islanders and the Rangers. Which is
the output? According to our rule, they both are. This is not allowed.
This “function” doesn’t give us a single straight answer, and so it is
not a function after all!<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>Now a couple of comments are important here. It does not matter that
most of the time this rule would have given only one output. If there is
even one single input that gives multiple outputs, the rule is not a
function. That doesn’t mean that it is meaningless, or that it doesn’t
describe any real relationship. But it does mean it is not a function.
Rules like our NHL example that can give multiple outputs for an input
are called multifunctions and are used in some situations (though we
won’t be using them in this book.) But they are absolutely not
functions.<br />
Secondly, sometimes people will mistakenly think a rule is not a
function because some inputs don’t give any output. If you input San
Diego into this rule, for example, you don’t get an output, because San
Diego does not have a current NHL team. This is not a problem. That only
means that San Diego is not in the domain! A rule does not have to give
an output for every imaginable input to be a function. The rule only has
to give one and only one output for each input in its domain.</p>
<div id="FunctionsExample13" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 4.13</strong>. Let <span
class="math inline"><em>k</em>(<em>t</em>)</span> be the rule that
assigns to each current NHL team the team’s named home. Is <span
class="math inline"><em>k</em>(<em>t</em>)</span> a function?</p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span> This rule is set up to take teams as
inputs and give homes as outputs: <span
class="math display">$$\text{team} \rightarrow \boxed{k} \rightarrow
\text{home}$$</span> Now, here we do not have the problem from the
previous example. If you input the Sabres you get Buffalo, input the
Bruins you get Boston, etc. But if you input the Rangers you get one and
only one output: New York. And if you input the Islanders you also get
one and only one output: New York. The fact that two distinct inputs
give the same output is not a problem! Since no two teams have two named
homes, this is a function.<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>It is important to contrast these last two examples. Remember: a
function must give one and only one output for each input. If there is
even one input that gives two outputs according to a rule, that rule is
not a function. So, this is not OK:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$\text{New York} \rightarrow \boxed{h}
\begin{array}{l} \rightarrow \text{Rangers?}\\ \rightarrow
\text{Islanders?} \end{array}$$</span></p>
<p>But there is absolutely nothing wrong with two inputs sharing the
same output. This is OK:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$\begin{array}{l} \text{Rangers}
\rightarrow \\ \text{Islanders} \rightarrow \end{array} \boxed{k}
\begin{array}{l} \rightarrow \text{New York}\\ \rightarrow  \text{New
York} \end{array}$$</span></p>
<p>The key to functions is that they must never give an ambiguous
answer. In the first case, is the output the Rangers or the Islanders?
Can’t tell? Well, that’s a problem. In the second case, there’s no
ambiguity about what the output is for any input. So that’s not a
problem at all.</p>
<div id="FunctionsExample14" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 4.14</strong>. Is the following rule a function? Why
or why not? <span
class="math inline"><em>p</em>(<em>x</em>) = 42</span></p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span> This rule is a bit ridiculous. No
matter what you input for <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>,
you always get the same output: <span class="math inline">42</span>.
However, that makes this a perfectly fine function. There is nothing you
could possibly input for <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>
that would give you two or more different outputs. There is always one
and only one output for any given input. So this rule is a
function.<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>It is important to note that when you are showing that a rule is not
a function, all you need to do is give any one input that has two
outputs. There is no need to discuss whether or not the example you give
is the only one, one of many, or one of infinitely many. Don’t get
bogged down in extra unnecessary details. To show that a rule is not a
function, you only need one input that gives more than one output.
Anything more is unnecessary.</p>

<h2 id="FunctionsandGraphs">Functions and Graphs</h2>
<p>As we saw in the preceding section, functions can be represented in
many different ways. If a rule gives one and only one output for each
input, it’s a function, whether we specify that rule using a formula, a
description, a table, or some other means.<br />
In this section we’ll discuss another tool for describing, and working
with, functions. You probably already have some experience work working
with this tool, but in this section we’ll develop the idea of a graph in
the framework of functions. If some of this section is old news to you,
you’ll still want to walk through this carefully, to see how graphs and
functions are related to each other. If, on the other hand, you don’t
have much experience with them, don’t panic – we’ll build everything
from the ground up.</p>
<h3 id="functions-and-coordinates">Functions and Coordinates</h3>
<p>We’ve already discussed the use of tables as a way of describing a
function. A table is simply an organized list of the inputs for a
function together with their outputs. An alternative way of doing this
is to use coordinate pairs. A coordinate pair is a way of writing a
given input together with its output, written in the form:</p>
<div class="center">
<p><span class="math inline">(input value, output value)</span></p>
</div>
<p>For example, suppose we define a function using the following
table:</p>
<div class="center">
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align: center;"><span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span></th>
<th style="text-align: center;"><span class="math inline">0</span></th>
<th style="text-align: center;"><span class="math inline">1</span></th>
<th style="text-align: center;"><span class="math inline">2</span></th>
<th style="text-align: center;"><span class="math inline">3</span></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;"><span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>)</span></td>
<td style="text-align: center;"><span class="math inline">5</span></td>
<td style="text-align: center;"><span class="math inline">4</span></td>
<td style="text-align: center;"><span class="math inline">9</span></td>
<td style="text-align: center;"><span class="math inline">−2</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<p>We could also define this function with a list of coordinate pairs
for each input and output. The table tells us that for the input <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em> = 0</span> we get the output <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(0) = 5</span>. As a coordinate pair, we
would write this as <span class="math inline">(0, 5)</span>. Likewise,
we could express the fact that <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(1) = 4</span> by writing the coordinate
pair <span class="math inline">(1, 4)</span>. And so on. Listing out the
remaining inputs and outputs in the same way, we could represent this
function as a set of coordinate pairs:</p>
<p><span
class="math display">{(0, 5), (1, 4), (2, 9), (3, −2)}</span></p>
<p>(the curly brackets are used to indicate that this is a set of
coordinate pairs).</p>

<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span> Following the pattern of <span

</div>
<div id="FunctionsandGraphsExample2" class="example">

<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span> Following the pattern again, we
would write this as the coordinate pair <span
class="math inline">(3, 5)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>You may notice that coordinate pairs look an exactly like interval
notation, <span class="math inline">(3, 5)</span> read as a coordinate
pair means “the input <span class="math inline">3</span> gives the
output <span class="math inline">5</span>”; but <span
class="math inline">(3, 5)</span> read as an interval means “all the
real numbers between <span class="math inline">3</span> and <span
class="math inline">5</span> not including <span
class="math inline">3</span> and <span class="math inline">5</span>
themselves.” It is really unfortunate that the same notation can be
correctly interpreted as two completely different things. Fortunately,
though, this is almost never a problem because it is just about always
clear from context whether we are talking about a coordinate pair or an
interval.<br />
Any function that can be described with a table can be described with
coordinate pairs. And so, anything we can do with a function as a table
we can do with a function as a set of coordinate pairs.</p>
<div id="FunctionsandGraphsExample3" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 4.17</strong>. Is <span
class="math inline">{(0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 5), (3, 6), (5, 11)}</span> a
function?</p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span> In this set of coordinate pairs,
each distinct input has one and only one output. Therefore this is a
function.</p>
</div>
<div id="FunctionsandGraphsExample4" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 4.18</strong>. Is <span
class="math inline">{(0, 5), (1, −3), (3, 6), (−2, 7), (1, 0)}</span> a

</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span> In this set of coordinate pairs we
have both <span class="math inline">(1, −3)</span> and <span
class="math inline">(1, 0)</span>. This means that the input <span
class="math inline">1</span> gets both <span
class="math inline">−3</span> and <span class="math inline">0</span> as
outputs. A function cannot give two different outputs for the same
input. This is not a function.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="graphs">Graphs</h3>
<p>Tables, and lists of coordinate pairs, both are very limited. If we
are working with a function that has just a few possible inputs, then
tables and lists of coordinate pairs are a simple and efficient way of
giving the function. But if a function has a big domain with lots of
possible inputs, producing a table or a list of coordinate pairs is
impractical if not impossible.<br />
For example, let’s start by considering a fairly simple function, the
doubling function <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = 2<em>x</em></span>. The
domain of this function is all real numbers – if we give this function
any real number at all, the function can double it and give us the
result as an output.<br />
We could give some <u>sample</u> values of this function in a table,
such as this:</p>
<div class="center">
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align: center;">x</th>
<th style="text-align: center;">0</th>
<th style="text-align: center;">1</th>
<th style="text-align: center;">2</th>
<th style="text-align: center;">3</th>
<th style="text-align: center;">4</th>
<th style="text-align: center;">5</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;">f(x)</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">0</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">2</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">4</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">6</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">8</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">10</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<p>which might be useful to give a sense, by examples, of just what this
function does. But this table does not fully describe the function,
because it only gives the outputs for the comparatively few selected
inputs listed in the table. We might assume from this table what the
outputs would be for other inputs, but we could not, just from this
table, know for sure. This table certainly looks like we’ve got the
doubling function in mind. It certainly looks like if we input <span
class="math inline">6</span> we’d get an output of <span
class="math inline">12</span>. But we can’t tell for sure. This table
only tells us the outputs for the specific inputs listed.<br />
On the face of it, it seems like it would be impossible to create a
table that would list all infinitely many inputs and outputs for the
doubling function. But, it turns out that there actually is a way to do
this. How do you make a list of all the real numbers? Well, in fact you
already know a way of doing this: by drawing a number line.<br />
A number line “lists” all the real numbers because every real number
corresponds to a point on the line. Some of the numbers, such as <span
class="math inline">−3</span>, <span class="math inline">0</span> and
<span class="math inline">5</span> are marked specifically on the number
line below. But we understand the other numbers are there as well. Where
is <span class="math inline">4.75</span>?<br />
Well, we understand it to be at the point <span
class="math inline">$\frac{3}{4}$</span> of the way between 4 and 5.
Where is <span class="math inline">−3, 000, 000</span>?<br />
Well, we understand that arrow to the left to mean the line continues
forever, and so it eventually gets to the right place.</p>

class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>-axis</strong>.<br />
The output values for the function are represented using the vertical
number line, known as the <strong>vertical axis, or output
axis</strong>, or, since the most common variable name to use for
outputs is <span class="math inline"><em>y</em></span>, <strong>the
<span class="math inline"><em>y</em></span>-axis</strong>.</p>
<figure>
<img src="Sections/FunctionsandGraphsImages/Figure03.png" />
<figcaption>A set of coordinate axes.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Any coordinate pair can be represented as a point in this plane. The
<span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em></span> values of the coordinate pair give
its point’s location. We move right or left along the <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>-axis to the <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> value, and then from there we move
up or down parallel to the <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em></span>-axis to the <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em></span> value. For example, the coordinate
pair <span class="math inline">(3, −2)</span> would be represented by
the point in the plane shown below:</p>
<figure>
<img src="Sections/FunctionsandGraphsImages/Figure04.png" />
<figcaption>The point <span class="math inline">(3, −2)</span> marked on
a set of axes.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Now, we can represent any numerical table as a collection of points
in the plane. The table we create above, giving a few selected inputs
and outputs for the function <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = 2<em>x</em></span> could be
represented by the following points in the plane:</p>
<figure>
<img src="Sections/FunctionsandGraphsImages/Figure05.png" />
<figcaption>Some input-output pairs for <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = 2<em>x</em></span>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Now here’s the infinitely clever part. If we want to represent all
the input-output pairs for a function, we can actually do that. Notice
that the points we plotted for <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = 2<em>x</em></span> in the
diagram above all seem to fall into a pattern – they seem to fall in a
straight line. It turns out that if we plotted all the input-output
pairs for <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = 2<em>x</em></span> they
would form a straight line like this:</p>
<figure>
<img src="Sections/FunctionsandGraphsImages/Figure06.png" />
<figcaption>The line formed by input-output pairs for <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = 2<em>x</em></span>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Note that for the time being, you’ll have to take it on faith that
all the input-output pairs for this function actually do fall into this
line; in the next chapter we’ll see how we know for sure that the
input-output pairs are precisely the same as the points on the line. It
should though seem reasonable to expect there is something more than
just a coincidence going on that the points we plotted happen to fit a
straight line.<br />
For many functions, the points for all the input-output pairs will form
straight lines like this one. There are other possibilities, however.
For example, if we consider the function <span
class="math inline"><em>g</em>(<em>x</em>) = <em>x</em><sup>2</sup></span>
we can create this table:</p>
<div class="center">
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align: center;"><span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span></th>
<th style="text-align: center;">-3</th>
<th style="text-align: center;">-2</th>
<th style="text-align: center;">-1</th>
<th style="text-align: center;">0</th>
<th style="text-align: center;">1</th>
<th style="text-align: center;">2</th>
<th style="text-align: center;">3</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;"><span
class="math inline"><em>g</em>(<em>x</em>)</span></td>
<td style="text-align: center;">9</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">4</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">1</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">0</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">1</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">4</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">9</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<p>and if we plot the points from this table in the plane we get:</p>
<figure>
<img src="Sections/FunctionsandGraphsImages/Figure07.png" />
<figcaption>Some of the input-output pairs for the function <span
class="math inline"><em>g</em>(<em>x</em>) = <em>x</em><sup>2</sup></span>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>which clearly can’t be made to fit any straight line. It turns out
(again, we’ll see exactly why this is later) that the actual collection
of points for this function looks like this:</p>
<figure>
<img src="Sections/FunctionsandGraphsImages/Figure08.png" />
<figcaption>The shape formed by the input-output pairs for <span
class="math inline"><em>g</em>(<em>x</em>) = <em>x</em><sup>2</sup></span>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Even though that’s not a straight line, it definitely fits a pattern.
That’s huge. It turns out that when we plot all the points for all the
input-output pairs for just about any function we might care about, the
result will always be some reasonable shape or pattern.<br />
The collection of all the input-output pairs for a function plotted in a
coordinate plane is called a <strong>graph</strong> of the function. We
will see in the upcoming chapters of this book that graphs are an
incredibly powerful tools for working with functions.<br />
Before moving on, there are a few terms that are commonly used with
graphs and the coordinate plane that we should define. The point <span
class="math inline">(0, 0)</span> that lies in the center where the two
axes intersect is called the <strong>origin</strong>. You can think of
the origin as the “starting point” from which we move to the coordinates
of other points.<br />
Also, the two axes naturally divide the coordinate plan into four
quarters, which are called <strong>quadrants</strong>. The quadrants are
numbered, usually with Roman numerals, starting in the upper right and
moving around counter-clockwise, as shown below:</p>
<figure>
<img src="Sections/FunctionsandGraphsImages/Figure09.png" />
<figcaption>The quadrants of the Cartesian Plane.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Quadrant I is called the <strong>first quadrant</strong>, quadrant II
is called the <strong>second quadrant</strong>, etc.<br />
</p>
<div id="FunctionsandGraphsExample5" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 4.19</strong>. Sketch the location of the point <span
class="math inline">(−3, 1)</span> in the Cartesian plane. In which
quadrant is this point located?</p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>To locate this point we follow the
input (horizontal) axis from the origin to the left to <span

<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>Because the first coordinate is <span

<p>This point does not lie in any quadrant. It is located directly on
the output (vertical) axis between Quadrants III and IV.</p>
</div>
<p>We can create graphs for functions whose formulas we know (more on
that later). We can also, though, use graphs even without formulas as a
way of describing functions. For example, suppose you are filling a tub
with water at a steady rate. The amount of water in the tub is a
function of the time (since at any given time there is one and only one
amount of water in the tub). Can we sketch a graph of what this function
would look like?<br />
If we assume the starting time (when “time is zero”) is when we first
started the water flowing in, we know that the graph must include the
origin, since when the time is zero (i.e. when we start) the amount of
water in the tub is also zero (i.e. the tub is empty). Then as time
passes, the amount of water goes up at a steady rate, so our graph
should also go up at a steady rate until the tub is full, at which point
the graph would level off. So, the graph should look something like
this:</p>
<figure>
<img src="Sections/FunctionsandGraphsImages/Figure12.png" />
<figcaption>Graph of water in the tub as a function of time</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Now, we can’t put numbers on this graph because we don’t have that
information; we don’t know the rate of the water’s flow, the volume of
the tub, how long it took to fill, etc. But we can label the axes with
the quantities each axis represents, and we can feel confident that this
graph communicates the idea of filling the tub at a steady rate.<br />
Notice that in this graph we only are looking at the first quadrant.
This is because our interest lies only with positive values of the
variables. We are not interested in the amount of water in the tub
before we begin to fill it, and there could never be negative amount of
water in the tub. Of course we could include show those empty quadrants
if we wanted to for some reason, but doing so would serve no
purpose.<br />
When using a graph to describe a function you should always label the
graph with as much relevant information as you have available. At a
minimum, the axes should always be labeled. If other information is
available, that may be included as well.</p>
<div id="FunctionsandGraphsExample7" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 4.21</strong>. A radioactive isotope of iodine decays
with a half life of 8 hours (that is, one half of the isotope decays
every 8 hours). A lab has a 20 gram sample of this isotope. Sketch a
graph of the remaining amount of the isotope as a function of time.</p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>The amount is decreasing, so our
graph should move downward. It cannot move down in a straight line,
though, because if it did the graph would eventually fall below the
horizontal axis – meaning a negative amount of iodine, which is
ridiculous. So, the graph must curve downward.<br />
We can get a sense of how this would work by plotting a few points based
on the information we have. Since the amount is reduced by half every 8
hours, we can figure out the amounts we have at 8 hour intervals:<br />
</p>

<p>Roughly plotting these points:</p>
<figure>
<img src="Sections/FunctionsandGraphsImages/Figure13.png" />
</figure>
<p>gives us a sense of what the graph must look like. Connecting these
dots into a smooth shape and labeling we should end up with a graph
something like this:</p>
<figure>
<img src="Sections/FunctionsandGraphsImages/Figure14.png" />
</figure>
<p>It is not necessary and probably not even desirable to show all the
plotted points specifically labeled; but it would be good to label a few
values to give a sense of scale. A graph such as this would be a good
choice:</p>
<figure>
<img src="Sections/FunctionsandGraphsImages/Figure15.png" />
</figure>
</div>
<p>Graphs can take on all sorts of shapes. For example, here is graph
for the closing price of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (a reflection
of the US stock market) as a function of time over the years
2008-2009:</p>
<figure>
<img src="Sections/FunctionsandGraphsImages/Figure16.png" />
</figure>
<p>And of course wilder shapes are possible. Is there any restriction on
what shapes a graph can take? Well, what about a “graph” like this
one:</p>
<figure>
<img src="Sections/FunctionsandGraphsImages/Figure17.png" />
<figcaption>Could this be a graph of a function?</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This is a nice, smooth, geometrically pretty shape. Shapes don’t come
much nicer than circles. But could it be the graph of a function? Well,
no, actually. Remember that a function must give <u>one and only one</u>
output for each input in its domain.<br />
The input <span class="math inline"><em>x</em> = 6</span> does not have
an output here, but that is fine if this were the graph of a function.
That just means <span class="math inline">6</span> is not in the domain.
The problem lies with inputs like <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em> = 3</span>. What is the output for the
input <span class="math inline"><em>x</em> = 3</span>? Well based on
where the marks on the axis are located, it looks as though the point
<span class="math inline">(3, 4)</span> is on the graph, so we might
think the output must be <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em> = 4</span>. Or, in other words, <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(3) = 4</span>. But the point <span
class="math inline">(3, −4)</span> is also appears to be on the graph,
so the output for <span class="math inline"><em>x</em> = 3</span> must
also be <span class="math inline"><em>y</em> = −4</span>. Or in other
words, <span class="math inline"><em>f</em>(3) = −4</span> too. And that
is a problem. Remember, a function must always give a straight answer!
For the input <span class="math inline"><em>x</em> = 3</span> the
“graph” cannot show two different outputs. Therefore this circle cannot
be the graph of a function.<br />
There’s nothing special about the input <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em> = 3</span>. We could have used lots of
other choices for <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> and run
into the same problem. In fact, we could have used any input where the
graph shows to different outputs. We don’t even need to be able to tell
what the specific outputs are. If we used the input <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em> = −2.5</span>, say, we might not be able
to tell very well what the corresponding outputs are, but we could tell
that there are two of them.</p>
<figure>
<img src="Sections/FunctionsandGraphsImages/Figure18.png" />
<figcaption>Drawing a vertical line shows how the input value we’ve
drawn it through has two outputs</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The observation we are making here is sometimes referred to as the
vertical line test.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><strong><u>The Vertical Line Test</u></strong><br />
A graph is the graph of a function if, and only if,<br />
you can never draw a vertical line which intersects the graph more than
once.<br />
OR equivalently<br />
A graph is the graph of a function if, and only if,<br />
every vertical line you can draw will intersect the graph at most one
time.</p>
</div>
<p>Because the only requirement of a function is that it give one and
only one output for each input, the only requirement for a graph to be a
function is the vertical line test.</p>
<h3 id="the-graphing-calculator">The Graphing Calculator</h3>
<p>Throughout this course, we will be using graphs extensively. A
graphing calculator is required for this course, and before we conclude
this section we will introduce the use of the calculator to obtain
graphs of functions when we know their formulas. (We’ll just introduce
the basics here, and expand on the use of the graphing calculator in
future chapters.)<br />
Let’s return to the function we started this chapter with, <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = 2<em>x</em></span>. We can
use the calculator to obtain a graph of this function using the
following process.<br />
<strong>Step 1: Enter the function formula into the calculator.</strong>
We first need to tell the calculator the formula for the function we
want to graph. (We do this the same way that we entered formulas to
create tables in Chapter ??.) First, hit the “Y=” key in the upper left
corner of your TI-83 or 84, and then enter the formula on the first
(“Y1=”) line. As with tables, the other lines (“Y2=”, “Y3=” etc.) are
there to allow you to enter more than one formula at a time – not
something we care about right now. Also as with tables, the formula must
be written with “X” as the input variable. Use the “X,T,<span
class="math inline"><em>Θ</em></span>,n” key to get an “X”. The
resulting screen should look like this:</p>
<figure>
<img src="Sections/FunctionsandGraphsImages/Figure19.png" />
</figure>
<p><strong>Step 2: Set the window.</strong> The Cartesian plane extends
out to infinity in all directions, and many graphs do as well. So of
course there is no way to display the whole plane on the calculator
screen. We need to tell the calculator what portion of the plane we want
it to display.<br />
In the calculator’s top row there is a key labeled “WINDOW”. Hit that
key now, and it will take you to a screen that should look like this
(though the specific numbers you see may not be the same):</p>
<figure>
<img src="Sections/FunctionsandGraphsImages/Figure20.png" />
</figure>
<p>The “Xmin” and “Xmax” tell the calculator the interval of <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> (input) values to show on the
graph. On the screen shown above as an example, the calculator would
show the portion of the graph that lies between <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em> = −8</span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em> = 8</span>. Likewise, the “Ymin” and
“Ymax” determine the range of <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em></span> (output) values used; in this
window it would be the portion of the graph that lies between <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em> = −6</span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em> = 6</span>.<br />
The “Xscl” and “Yscl” determine where the marks on the axes occur. These
both being set to 1 tells the calculator to mark both axes in intervals
of 1 unit. The “Xres” helps determine how precisely the calculator
sketches the points on the graph; the precise way in which this is used
need no concern us right now. We will just leave that at the default of
Xres=1.<br />
The settings to enter here will depend on what portion of the graph you
want to look at in any particular situation. The default, which we’ll
use whenever we don’t have reason to look elsewhere, is the standard
window, which ranges from <span class="math inline">−10</span> to <span
class="math inline">+10</span> on both axes, with hashmarks (ticks)
every one unit. So, to set things to the standard window, we would want
the following settings:</p>
<figure>
<img src="Sections/FunctionsandGraphsImages/Figure21.png" />
</figure>
<p><strong>Step 3: Get the graph.</strong> In the upper right corner,
you’ll see a key labeled “GRAPH”. Hit that key now and you should see
this:</p>
<figure>
<img src="Sections/FunctionsandGraphsImages/Figure22.png" />
</figure>
<p>As an alternative, when you want a graph in the standard window, you
can just hit the “ZOOM” key in your calculator’s upper row, and select
“6: ZStandard”:</p>
<figure>
<img src="Sections/FunctionsandGraphsImages/Figure23.png" />
</figure>
<p>This will take you directly to the graph in the standard window,
essentially combining Step 2 and Step 3.<br />
<strong>It is important to remember that the calculator only shows the
portion of the graph that our window instructions tell it to.</strong>
It should be apparent that the graph of <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = 2<em>x</em></span>
continues above and below the graph we generated above. If you wish to
see those portions of the graph, you can adjust your window settings and
see them. But whether we see them or not, they are there, and while we
can’t see them on the calculator’s screen with our actual eyes, we can
see them with the mind’s eye.<br />
Following these steps, we can now create a graph for just about function
defined with a formula. Our goal is of course not just to admire these
graphs’ beauty – we want to use them as a tool, and as we proceed
through the course we’ll see more and more how to do this. Before
leaving this chapter, though, we’ll mention at least one use for these
graphs.<br />
Since a function’s graph consists of all its input-output pairs, we can
use graphs to find the output for any given input. The calculator allows
you to “walk” along the graph, telling you the coordinates of points you
encounter along the way. In the top row of your calculator you will see
a key labeled “TRACE”. If you hit this key, you’ll see a “blob” placed
somewhere on the graph, and the input and output values of its
coordinates:</p>
<figure>
<img src="Sections/FunctionsandGraphsImages/Figure24.png" />
</figure>
<p>If you don’t see the coordinate values, hit “2nd” “ZOOM” (that is,
“FORMAT”) and make sure your settings are like this:</p>
<figure>
<img src="Sections/FunctionsandGraphsImages/Figure25.png" />
</figure>
<p>You can now move around to different points on the graph by using the
right and left directional keys in the upper right portion of your
calculator.<br />
As you do this you’ll notice that not every point on the graph is
visited when you trace. That can’t be avoided – there are infinitely
many points on the graph, so there’s no way you could visit them all! To
visit the point on the graph associated with a given input value, hit
“2nd” “TRACE” (that is, “CALC”) in the top row to get this menu:</p>
<figure>
<img src="Sections/FunctionsandGraphsImages/Figure26.png" />
</figure>
<p>Select “1: value” and you’ll be returned to the graph with a screen
that looks like this:</p>
<figure>
<img src="Sections/FunctionsandGraphsImages/Figure27.png" />
</figure>
<p>Now you can enter the input (<span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>) value you want to visit. If we
want, say, to visit the point that goes with <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em> = −3</span> we get:</p>
<figure>
<img src="Sections/FunctionsandGraphsImages/Figure28.png" />
</figure>
<div id="FunctionsandGraphsExample8" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 4.22</strong>. Obtain a graph for <span
class="math inline">$h(t)=\frac{t^3+3t^2}{12}$</span> in the standard
window, and use this graph to find <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em>(2)</span></p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>Following the steps outlined above,
we first need to enter the function’s formula into the calculator.
Recall that the calculator only understands X as the input value, so we
need to rewrite that formula replacing the <span
class="math inline"><em>t</em></span> with an X:</p>
<figure>
<img src="Sections/FunctionsandGraphsImages/Figure29.png" />
</figure>
<p>Now, either directly adjusting the window setting to the standard
window and hitting “GRAPH”, or just using “ZOOM” –&gt; “6: ZStandard”,
we get:</p>
<figure>
<img src="Sections/FunctionsandGraphsImages/Figure30.png" />
</figure>
<p>Then using “2nd” “TRACE” (that is, “CALC”) –&gt; “1: value” and
entering “X=2” we get:</p>
<figure>
<img src="Sections/FunctionsandGraphsImages/Figure31.png" />
</figure>
<p>So, we conclude that <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em>(2) = 1.6666667</span> which we would
either recognize as <span class="math inline">$h(2)=\frac{5}{3}$</span>
or round t0 something reasonable such as <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em>(2) = 1.67</span>.</p>

share.</p></li>
<li><p>The stock began the year at around $2 per share, and over the

mid–year it started to move upward again for a month or so, approaching
but not quite returning to where it started the year, and then leveled
off for a few months. Finally, the company unexpectedly filed for
bankruptcy, and on that news the stock fell dramatically and ended the
year nearly worthless.</p></li>
<li><p>The stock began the year at around $2 per share, and gradually
wavered between $1.75 and $2.25 for the first half of the year. A bit
past midyear, the company received a buyout offer at $5 per share, and
the stock immediately shot up to nearly that price, where it remained
until the deal was completed at year’s end.</p></li>

<h2 id="SolvingEquationsGraphically">Solving Equations Graphically</h2>
<p>Graphs are a powerful tool which we will exploit throughout this
book. A particularly powerful use for graphs is as a tool to solve
equations, particularly in cases where traditional algebra methods would
be tedious or ineffective. In this chapter we will introduce this method
and discuss when it is - and when it is not - a useful alternative.</p>
<h3 id="graphical-solution">Graphical Solution</h3>
<p>We’ll begin this chapter by showing how we could use a graph to solve
a fairly simple equation. Consider, for example, the equation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">2<em>x</em> − 1 = 7</span></p>
<p>Now, it is not hard to solve this equation with traditional algebra.
Add one to both sides, divide by two, and you can quickly conclude that
the solution is <span class="math inline"><em>x</em> = 4</span>. Fair
enough. But we also could have seen this in another way.<br />
The algebraic expression on the left side of that equation can be used
to define a function, <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = 2<em>x</em> − 1</span>.
Using the calculator, we can readily obtain a graph of this function
(shown below in the standard window):</p>
<figure>
<img src="Sections/SolvingEquationsGraphically/Figure01.png" />
<figcaption>Graph of <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = 2<em>x</em> − 1</span> in
the standard window</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Now, remember that a graph for a function consists of all of its
input-output pairs. For example, <span class="math inline">(5, 9)</span>
lies on this graph, because when you input <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em> = 5</span> into the function <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = 2<em>x</em> − 1</span> the
resulting output is <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(5) = 9</span>.<br />
Now, solving the equation <span
class="math inline">2<em>x</em> − 1 = 7</span> amounts to asking “what
<span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> value do we need to input
into <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = 2<em>x</em> − 1</span> to
get <span class="math inline">7</span> as the resulting output?” We can
find this by looking for the point on the graph where the output value
is <span class="math inline">7</span>; that is, where <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = 7</span>.<br />
We could try to do this by tracing along the graph to get to the point
we are seeking, but we can find it more efficiently in another way. If
we consider the right side of the equation as also defining a function
<span class="math inline"><em>g</em>(<em>x</em>) = 7</span> and graph
that function, the result is just a flat horizontal line whose output
value stays at <span class="math inline">7</span> no matter where we go
on the input axis (shown below in the standard window):</p>
<figure>
<img src="Sections/SolvingEquationsGraphically/Figure02.png" />
<figcaption>Graph of <span
class="math inline"><em>g</em>(<em>x</em>) = 7</span> in the standard
window</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Now, we can graph the right-side function and left-side function
together. The “Y=” screen allows us to enter more than one function at
once, so if we do this:</p>
<figure>
<img src="Sections/SolvingEquationsGraphically/Figure03.png" />
<figcaption>Entering two function in the calculator</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>And then we get both graphed together in the same window:</p>
<figure>
<img src="Sections/SolvingEquationsGraphically/Figure04.png" />
<figcaption>Graph of <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = 2<em>x</em> − 1</span> and
<span class="math inline"><em>g</em>(<em>x</em>) = 7</span> in the
standard window</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Now, how does this help? Well, we are looking for the place where the
output of <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = 2<em>x</em> − 1</span> is
<span class="math inline">7</span> – or, in other words, where the graph
of <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = 2<em>x</em> − 1</span> is
at a height of <span class="math inline">7</span>. But the output of
<span class="math inline"><em>g</em>(<em>x</em>) = 7</span> is always
<span class="math inline">7</span>, or, in other words, the graph of
<span class="math inline"><em>g</em>(<em>x</em>) = 7</span> is always at
a height of <span class="math inline">7</span>. So, the point on the
graph of <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = 2<em>x</em> − 1</span> that
we are looking for is the point where the two graphs intersect!<br />
The calculator has programs built in to find the intersection between
two graphs. We’ll walk through that right now, step-by-step.<br />
In the top row of your calculator, you will see a key labeled “TRACE”
which is marked above as “CALC”. Hit “2nd” and then this key to reach
the “CALC” menu. You should see this:</p>
<figure>
<img src="Sections/SolvingEquationsGraphically/Figure05.png" />
<figcaption>The “CALC” menu</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Now, select “5: Intersect” and the graphs will appear:</p>
<figure>
<img src="Sections/SolvingEquationsGraphically/Figure06.png" />
<figcaption>The first step toward finding the intersection</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Now we are ready to work through the calculator program to find the
intersection. Because the calculator can store more than two graphs, the
program first asks you to confirm which two graphs you want to
intersect. (Unfortunately, you still have to do this even if you’ve only
entered two!) The “First curve?” question at the bottom of the screen is
asking you to confirm that one of the two graphs you want to intersect
is indeed the one shown in the upper left-hand corner, “Y1=2X-1”. (The
word “curve” is an old-fashioned word for graph; for our purposes you
can just read this as meaning the same thing as “graph”.) Since this is
correct, you only need to hit “Enter” to confirm. The screen should now
show this:</p>
<figure>
<img src="Sections/SolvingEquationsGraphically/Figure07.png" />
<figcaption>The second step toward finding the intersection</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Since “Y2=7” is indeed the other graph, hit “Enter” again to
confirm.</p>
<figure>
<img src="Sections/SolvingEquationsGraphically/Figure08.png" />
<figcaption>The third step toward finding the intersection</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The calculator is now asking for a guess. The calculator will find
the intersection that is closest to the guess you enter here. Since
there is only one intersection, this doesn’t really matter, though when
there is more than one intersection (which we will see an example of
shortly) this step is important. Here, you can use the arrow keys to
move the blob closer to the intersection if you like, but you can also
just hit “Enter” without changing anything and let it go:</p>
<figure>
<img src="Sections/SolvingEquationsGraphically/Figure09.png" />
<figcaption>Found the intersection</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>So the intersection occurs at <span
class="math inline">(4, 7)</span>. Our goal though was to solve the
original equation, so this is not quite the answer we were looking for.
We set these graphs up so that the input (<span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>) value of their intersection would
be the solution to the original equation. So, we conclude that the
solution is:</p>
<p><span class="math display"><em>x</em> = 4</span></p>
<p>which agrees with the answer we got solving using traditional
algebra.<br />
Now, the equation in this example we’ve worked through was quite simple,
chosen just to illustrate how the method works. Given the choice, you’d
almost certainly not choose to use graphical solution for this one,
since traditional algebra would have been much less work. The point,
though, is that the graphing method works just as well if the algebra to
solve the equations would be more demanding. We’ll illustrate this with
a few examples.</p>
<div id="SolvingEquationsGraphicallyExample1" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 4.23</strong>. Solve <span
class="math inline"><em>t</em> + 2 = 4(2<em>t</em> + 1) − 2(3<em>t</em> − 1)</span></p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>We begin by making each side of the
equation a function, and entering them into the calculator. Remember
that in the calculator the input variable must always be rewritten as
“X”. So we enter:</p>
<figure>
<img src="Sections/SolvingEquationsGraphically/Figure10.png" />
<figcaption>Entering both sides of the equation</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Running through the steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Select “2nd” “TRACE” (i.e. “CALC”) –&gt; “5:Intersect”</p></li>
<li><p>Hit “Enter” to confirm we want to use Y1=X+2</p></li>
<li><p>Hit “Enter” to confirm we want to use Y2=4(2X+1) – 2(3X –
1)</p></li>
<li><p>Hit “Enter” to agree to the suggested guess</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We end up with:</p>
<figure>
<img src="Sections/SolvingEquationsGraphically/Figure11.png" />
<figcaption>The intersection on the calculator</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>From this we use the X-value of the intersection to conclude that the
solution to the equation is <span
class="math inline"><em>t</em> = −4</span><br />
We can check this is by substituting it back into the original equation.
(It’s not a bad idea to do this, since even though the calculator will
never make an error in finding the intersection, it is always possible
that you might make a typographical error entering the formulas.)</p>
</div>
<div id="SolvingEquationsGraphicallyExample2" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 4.24</strong>. Solve <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em><sup>2</sup> − 10 = 2<em>x</em></span>.
Round to two decimal places if necessary. This equation has two
solutions.</p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span> Now, this is actually a problem that
we cannot (yet) solve using traditional algebra, because if we try to
put the <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> terms together we
are unable to do so, because we cannot put the <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em><sup>2</sup></span> and <span
class="math inline">2<em>x</em></span> together – they are unlike terms.
Graphical solution still works just fine though.<br />
Starting with:</p>

<p>Running the intersect program up to the “Guess?” step we get:</p>
<figure>
<img src="Sections/SolvingEquationsGraphically/Figure13.png" />
<figcaption>Finding an intersection</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We can see there that there are two intersections between the graphs,
meaning that our equation has more than one solution. We will need to
run the intersect program twice, once to get each of the shown
solutions. Now, use the arrow keys to move the blob closer to the
intersection on the left. You don’t have to worry about getting really
close to it, you just need to be close enough that the calculator
clearly “understands” which intersection you are after. Then hitting
enter to confirm, you get:</p>
<figure>
<img src="Sections/SolvingEquationsGraphically/Figure14.png" />
<figcaption>First intersection</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>so one solution to the equation (rounded to two decimal places) is
<span class="math inline"><em>x</em> = −2.32</span>.<br />
We now need to run through the program again. Once we get to the “Guess”
step, we will need to use the arrow keys to move the blob closer to the
intersection on the right. We end up with:</p>
<figure>
<img src="Sections/SolvingEquationsGraphically/Figure15.png" />
<figcaption>Second intersection</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>So the equation’s two solutions are <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em> = −2.32</span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em> = 4.32</span>.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="window-setting-for-graphical-solution">Window Setting for
Graphical Solution</h3>
<p>In all of the examples we’ve seen so far, we’ve been able to find the
intersection(s) we were looking for within the standard window. Of
course this won’t always happen.<br />
The standard window is usually a good place to start but if the graphs
you see in the standard window don’t intersect you’ll have to change the
window so that you can see the intersection. Fortunately, you’re usually
not flying blind when you do this. The graph you see in the standard
window often will give you some hint about how you need to adjust.</p>
<div id="SolvingEquationsGraphicallyExample3" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 4.25</strong>. Solve <span
class="math inline">$\frac{1}{2}x+3=\frac{x+20}{3}$</span>
graphically</p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>We start with the standard
window:</p>
<figure>
<img src="Sections/SolvingEquationsGraphically/Figure16.png" />
<figcaption>Standard Window</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We don’t get an intersection in the standard window, but looking at
the graphs but they do appear to be coming together. If we try to run
the intersect program here, though we end up with this error:</p>
<figure>
<img src="Sections/SolvingEquationsGraphically/Figure17.png" />
<figcaption>Error screen</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Not the most descriptive error code ever written, but this is the
error you will get whenever you try to intersect two graphs that don’t
intersect within your window’s interval of <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>-values. The intersect program will
only find the intersection if it occurs within the interval of <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>-values that you have graphed. The
calculator is not “smart enough” to know to look for an intersection
outside that window.<br />
But the intersection does exist. We just have to adjust our window to
find it. Looking at the graphs, we can see that they appear to be
getting closer together as we move up and to the right. So, we need to
use a larger upper limit for both X and Y to find the intersection. We
can’t tell how much higher we need to go, but we can make a reasonable
guess and adjust as needed. Let’s try increasing both to <span
class="math inline">20</span>:</p>
<figure>
<img src="Sections/SolvingEquationsGraphically/Figure18.png" />
<figcaption>Xmax, Ymax set from <span class="math inline">10</span> to
<span class="math inline">20</span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>which gives us this view of the graphs:</p>
<figure>
<img src="Sections/SolvingEquationsGraphically/Figure19.png" />
<figcaption>New graph based on new window</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It’s not clear whether or not they actually intersect in this window.
If you try to run the Intersect program, though, you’ll see that they
don’t. It doesn’t look like we need to go higher to get the
intersection, but it does appear we need to go a bit farther to the
right. So, adjusting Xmax up to, say, <span
class="math inline">25</span>, and walking through the Intersect program
we end up with:</p>
<figure>
<img src="Sections/SolvingEquationsGraphically/Figure20.png" />
<figcaption>New graph based on new window</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>So we can conclude the solution to this equation is <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em> = 22</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>We don’t always get enough of a hint from the standard window,
though. Sometimes we need to actually take a look at some values of the
two functions to get a sense of a window where we might see the
graphs.</p>
<div id="SolvingEquationsGraphicallyExample4" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 4.26</strong>. Solve <span
class="math inline">$\frac{5-2x}{3}=3(2x+7)-5(x-2)$</span></p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span> We start by entering the two sides
of the equation as functions:</p>
<figure>
<img src="Sections/SolvingEquationsGraphically/Figure21.png" />
<figcaption>Treating both sides as functions in the
calculator</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>But if we look at these graphs in the standard window we see nothing
at all! These graphs both lie entirely outside the standard
window.<br />
</p>
<p>To get a hint of where to look, we can create a table. It doesn’t
much matter what values we try - we’re just trying to get any glimpse of
the graphs – so we’ll just use an automatic table starting at zero and
going up in increments of one unit:</p>
<figure>
<img src="Sections/SolvingEquationsGraphically/Figure22.png" />
<figcaption>Treating both sides as functions in the
calculator</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>From this we can see that if we are using X-values that fall within
the standard window, the Y-values are much higher than the standard
window. So, we might try something like switching to “Ymin=0” and
“Ymax=50”, which gives us this view:</p>
<figure>
<img src="Sections/SolvingEquationsGraphically/Figure23.png" />
<figcaption>Treating both sides as functions in the

</figure>
<p>Luckily, this view not only gives us a hint where the intersection
might be, it actually includes it. Completing the process of finding the
intersection, we get:</p>
<figure>
<img src="Sections/SolvingEquationsGraphically/Figure24.png" />
<figcaption>Treating both sides as functions in the

</figure>
<p>allowing us to conclude that the solution is <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em> = −8.6</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>Before concluding this discussion, there are a couple of additional
points which we should address.<br />
We saw in Example <a href="#FunctionsandGraphsExample2"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="FunctionsandGraphsExample2">4.16</a> that it’s possible
for an equation to have multiple solutions. Which raises the question:
how do we know in Examples <a href="#FunctionsandGraphsExample3"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="FunctionsandGraphsExample3">4.17</a> and <a
href="#FunctionsandGraphsExample4" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="FunctionsandGraphsExample4">4.18</a> that we got all the
solutions? We adjusted our window to find a solution ... but how do we
know that we wouldn’t find another if we looked elsewhere?<br />
In both of these examples, though, we had first degree equations. We
know from our prior experience of algebra that unless a first degree
equation is inconsistent (no solutions) or an identity (everything is a
solution) it will have one and only one solution. So, while we can’t say
for sure just by looking at the graphs whether or not there are other
solutions out there, what we know about algebra assures us that we don’t
have to worry about this with these examples. For equations that are not
first degree, such as the one in Example <a
href="#FunctionsandGraphsExample2" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="FunctionsandGraphsExample2">4.16</a>, you need to know
more about how they behave algebraically and graphically to know how
many solutions you are looking for. We will explore this in later
chapters of this book; for the time being, if you are asked to solve an
equation that is not first degree you will be given enough additional
information to know whether or not you need to look for additional
solutions.<br />
Another comment needs to be made about the window adjustment. It
actually is not necessary to see the intersection on your calculator
screen to find the intersection! The calculator requires that the
solution’s input value fall inside the window in order to find the
intersection, but it does not require the output value to fall within
the window. Or, said another way, the calculator cannot find the
intersection if it is to the right or left of the window, but it
actually can find the intersection if it falls above or below the
window. So sometimes if you don’t have the intersection in the window
but run the intersect program, you get the answer anyway. This actually
would have happened in Example <a href="#FunctionsandGraphsExample4"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="FunctionsandGraphsExample4">4.18</a> if we had not
adjusted the window to see the intersection. But since you can’t really
rely on that happening, it’s probably best to always try to get a window
that the intersection falls within.<br />
Sometimes you can get away with not seeing the intersection, sometimes
you can’t. It’s safer to always try to get the intersection on screen
before trying to find it.</p>
<h3 id="when-to-use-a-graphical-solution">When to Use a Graphical
Solution</h3>
<p>Graphical solution is a fantastically useful tool but it is not
always the best approach. Often a graphical approach will allow you to
solve an equation with much less effort than traditional algebra would
require. And sometimes as we’ve seen it even opens up the possibility of
solving equations we could not otherwise solve. But it’s also often true
that graphical solution is sometimes much more work than just working
through the problem with algebra.<br />
For example, let’s reconsider the first equation we used as an example
in this chapter:</p>
<p><span class="math display">2<em>x</em> − 1 = 7</span></p>
<p>This can be solved either way, but I think you’ll agree that the work
involved in solving this graphically was way more than the very minimal
effort it takes to solve it with algebra. We used this simple equation
as a first example to illustrate how graphical solution works, but in
fact you almost certainly would not want to use graphical solution given
the choice.<br />
On the other hand, and equation like this one:</p>
<p><span
class="math display">$$\frac{3}{5}x-\frac{2}{7}\left(\frac{4}{13}x+\frac{11}{3}
\right) = \frac{4}{9}-\frac{2}{11}x$$</span></p>
<p>seems like it would take a lot of effort to work through
algebraically. While it would be a pain to type each side in to the
calculator, that seems like less effort than slogging through clearing
all those fractions. For this equation, graphing might be a better
choice.<br />
</p>
<p>Of course, there’s no hard and fast rule about this. Which method
would be better to solve this one?</p>
<p><span
class="math display">3(2<em>x</em> − 5) − 5(7 + <em>x</em>) − 9 = 12 + 4(3<em>x</em> − 5) − 2(5<em>x</em> + 1)</span></p>
<p>On the one hand, solving this with algebra is going to involve a lot
of distributing and combining like terms. Solving graphically would
avoid that work. On the other hand, though, putting each side of this
equation into the “Y=” screen will involve a lot of typing, and even the
slightest typographical error will throw everything off. And, those are
all whole numbers, which are not too bad to work with. Which approach is
better? That’s really a judgment call – given the choice of methods to
solve this problem, whichever one sounds preferable to you is probably
the better choice for you. Someone else might choose differently,
depending on their own experience and preferences.<br />
</p>
<p>Even though there are no absolute rules here, we can make some
suggestions. In general:<br />

<p>The numbers in this equation are awkward, and solving this using

almost certainly the better bet.</p></li>
<li><p><span
class="math inline">$\frac{3}{2}w+(4-w)=\frac{2}{5}w-3$</span><br />
</p>
<p>This one is really a matter of preference. Because of the fractions

algebra will require some effort. But the fractions are not that bad and
the amount of simplification required won’t be excessive so it is
debatable whether that work is more or less effort than graphical
solution. Either approach would be a reasonable choice.</p></li>

<p>Now, the two graphs don’t intersect in this window, and it’s hard to
see which direction we should move if we want to find the intersection.
The graphs are not coming together in any obvious way. Now you could
spend hours driving yourself crazy trying to find an appropriate window
to get the intersection. Or you could just decide that maybe graphical
solution won’t work so well after all.<br />
Solving with algebra instead we get:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$\begin{array}{rcl}
		3(2-x)+5(x-1)&amp; = &amp;3x-2(2-5x)-11x\\
		&amp; &amp;\\
		6-3x+5x-5&amp;=&amp;3x-4+10x-11x\\
		&amp; &amp; \\
		2x+1&amp;=&amp;2x-4\\
		&amp; &amp;\\
		1&amp;=&amp;-4
	\end{array}$$</span></p>
<p>It turns out that this is an inconsistent equation: it has no
solutions. You could have spent the rest of your life looking for that
intersection, and you never would have found it. Stubbornly sticking
with graphical solution here would have condemned you to an eternity of
futility with your graphing calculator. The horror!<br />
You might object, saying that you could have seen from the initial
graphs that there would never be an intersection. The graphs certainly
looked like they were parallel lines, which never intersect.
Unfortunately, you can never tell that for sure just by looking at the
graph. If you set out to graphically solve:</p>
<p><span
class="math display">1.9999<em>x</em> + 2.5 = 2<em>x</em> − 1</span></p>
<p>your graphs also look like parallel lines</p>
<figure>
<img src="Sections/SolvingEquationsGraphically/Figure26.png" />
<figcaption>A very hard to find intersection</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>But in fact this equation does have a solution:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$\begin{array}{rcl}
		1.9999x+2.5&amp;=&amp;2x-1\\
		3.5&amp;=&amp;0.0001x\\
		x&amp;=&amp;35,000
	\end{array}$$</span></p>
<p>Just because you can’t find an intersection doesn’t mean that one
doesn’t exist. These graphs actually do intersect, but you’d have to
extend your window all the way out to include <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em> = 35, 000</span> within the window to
find it. It would take you a very long time before you’d come up with
that window.<br />
If you first try graphical solution and can’t find the intersection, it
is incorrect to conclude that no intersection exists. It is, though,
correct to conclude that maybe graphical solution isn’t the way to
go.<br />
In the exercises, you will find many problems where you are specifically
asked to use graphical solution. If you are specifically asked to solve
graphically, make sure to do so, even if you’d rather use traditional
algebra. It’s important to get enough practice with this method to have
it at the ready when you need it. In other exercises, though, you’ll
have the choice of methods. In these, and in the future, be flexible in
your approach. As we’ve seen, there are times when graphical solution is
by far the best approach, and other times where traditional algebra is
the way to go. If you are comfortable with both approaches, you’ll often
be able to save yourself needless exertion by having the option of
choosing the easier path.</p>

<p>A function does not have to be useful. If a rule gives one and only

is a perfectly good function because whenever you square a number you
get one and only one result. This is true regardless of whether or not
we have any useful reason for squaring numbers.<br />
We make no apologies for sometimes doing mathematics with no obvious
application to develop and practice ideas, skills and techniques (just
as a football coach makes no apologies for running drills and doing
exercises that are not themselves actually part of any football game).
But we also do want to keep in mind that most people study mathematics
because it is useful for something else they want or need to do!</p>
<h3 id="functions-as-mathematical-models">Functions as Mathematical
Models</h3>
<p>When we use mathematical tools to describe something about the world,
we say we are using a <strong>mathematical model</strong>. Functions are
a natural tool for mathematical modeling.<br />
Suppose, for example, that you are pumping water out to drain a swimming
pool. The pool started out full, with a volume of 7200 gallons of water,
and the pump is pulling out a steady 20 gallons per minute. There is a
relationship here between the time that has passed since the pump
started and the remaining volume of the pool, and we would like to be
able to set up a mathematical model for this relationship using a
function.<br />
To do this we first need to decide which quantity should be the input
and which should be the output. The more natural way to do this would be
to treat volume as a function of time, since the volume is changing as
the time changes. Also, at any given time the pool can only have one
volume (i.e. it is impossible for the pool to have two different volumes
at the same time!), so we know setting things up this way will meet the
requirements of a function. So our mathematical model would be based on
a function like this:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$time \rightarrow \boxed{f} \rightarrow
volume$$</span></p>
<p>Could we do it the other way around? Sometimes we can set up a model
with inputs and outputs switched, and which way we do it depends on
which approach we find more convenient or useful. Sometimes we can’t
because the model only works as a function one way, In this example, we
would run into some trouble if we tried to set things up with time as a
function of volume, like this:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$volume \rightarrow \boxed{f} \rightarrow
time$$</span></p>
<p>The problem is that the pool actually will have the same volume at
two different times. When will the pool be empty? Well, it will be empty
at the moment the pump finishes draining it. But it will also be empty a
minute after that! So, if you input a volume of zero gallons, you could
get more than one output of time when the volume is zero gallons. When
is the pool full? Well, it’s full when the pump first starts to run, but
it also was full a minute before that. So we run into the same problem
there as well.<br />
We could work around this if we had to, for example by adding that we
only want to know the time while the pump is running that the pool is at
the input volume. So, it actually might be possible to set up a function
model with time as a function of volume, but this makes things much more
complicated. So our original plan of setting up a model with volume as a
function of time seems the best bet.</p>
<div id="FunctionsasModelsExample1" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 4.28</strong>. To set up a function to mathematically
model each of the following, which quantity is the more natural choice
for input and which is the more natural choice for output? Explain your
reasoning, and state your answer in the form “ should be a function of
”.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>You are shooting a model rocket upward, and measuring its height
over the course of its flight.</p></li>
<li><p>Your monthly electric bill is based on the amount of electricity
you use.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span></p>
<ol>
<li><p>The two quantities are time since launch and height. It is
probably more natural to think of height as a function of time (i.e. you
input time and the model tells you the rocket’s height). This also works
as a function, because at each time (input) the rocket can only be at
one height (output) - the rocket can’t be in two different places at
once.<br />
On the other hand, if we try to use height as the input, we run into
trouble, since the rocket will be at the same height at more than one
time. If you ask, say, when the rocket will be <span
class="math inline">15</span> feet above the ground, there can be two
different answers: when it reaches that height on the way up and also on
the way down. So we cannot have a function that uses height as the input
and gives time as the output.<br />
So, we must set this up with time as the input and height as the output.
In other words, height should be a function of time.</p></li>
<li><p>This could probably be set up either way. If you use a certain
amount of electricity, the utility company will send you one and only
one bill for that use - they never send you two different bills and let
you pick which you want to pay. So if we input electric use, we get one
and only one bill amount.<br />
On the other hand, if we know your bill for the month, there probably is
only one amount of electric use that would give you that bill, since if
you use less it would probably be lower and if you use more it will
probably be higher. So, we could probably set this up with bill as input
and electric use as output.<br />
It seems more natural though, to set up the function like this: <span
class="math display">$$electricity \text{ } use \rightarrow \boxed{f}
\rightarrow bill$$</span> because this more closely reflects the way you
are most likely to look at this relationship. In reality, you use a
certain amount of electricity and then the utility uses that information
to determine your bill. The other way around - taking the amount of your
bill and using it to determine how much electricity you use - could make
sense if you were thinking about managing your electric use to fit a
budget, but is a less natural way of looking at things.<br />
So, we would probably set this model up with the bill amount being a
function of electric use.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>Once we have determined our input and output, we next need to find a
formula or other rule that fits the scenario we are trying to model.
Finding formulas to suit mathematical models will be a major topic of
the rest of this course and book, so we won’t get too deeply into that
quite yet. You are not expected to come up with formulas on your own
yet. For the swimming pool problem, we will note here that the pool
starts with <span class="math inline">7200</span> gallons and since it
is pumping at a rate of <span class="math inline">20</span> gallons per
minute, after <span class="math inline"><em>t</em></span> minutes <span
class="math inline">20<em>t</em></span> gallons will have been pumped
out. Putting that together, it turns out that the volume of water in the
pool as a function of time since the pump was turned on can be
mathematically modeled with the function</p>
<p><span
class="math display"><em>f</em>(<em>t</em>) = 7200 − 20<em>t</em></span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>t</em>)</span> is the
volume of water after <span class="math inline"><em>t</em></span>
minutes of pumping and <span class="math inline"><em>t</em></span> is
the minutes the pump has been running.<br />
While we are not going to spend much time trying to find formulas yet,
we are interested in how a formula can be used to get information about
the relationship we are mathematically modeling. Suppose, for example,
we want to know how much water will be left in the pool after one hour.
We can use this model to answer this question. Time is the input for
this function, so we can input into it a time of one hour. Since <span
class="math inline"><em>t</em></span> is the time in minutes, this means
we need to input <span class="math inline"><em>t</em> = 60</span> (since
an hour is <span class="math inline">60</span> minutes). So, doing this
we get:</p>
<p><span
class="math display"><em>f</em>(60) = 7200 − 20(60) = 6000</span></p>
<p>The output we get from the model is a value of <span
class="math inline">6000</span>. Since the output is the gallons of
water left in the pool, we can conclude that “after the pump has been
running for an hour, the volume of water in the pool is <span
class="math inline">6000</span> gallons.” Or, phrased a little more
naturally, “there are <span class="math inline">6000</span> gallons of
water left in the pool after the pump has been running for one
hour.”</p>
<div id="FunctionsasModelsExample2" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 4.29</strong>. Suppose that your electric bill in
dollars as a function of your monthly electric usage in kilowatt hours
is given by <span
class="math inline"><em>b</em>(<em>x</em>) = 7.95 + 0.1<em>x</em></span>.
Determine your electric bill if you use <span
class="math inline">800</span> kilowatt hours.</p>

<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>Since usage is the input, we need to

function model. So: <span

Interpreting this we would say something like this: “if you use <span

class="math inline">$87.95</span>.”</p>

<p><strong>Example 4.30</strong>. Suppose that the height of a toy
rocket in feet <span class="math inline"><em>t</em></span> seconds after
it is launched is given by the function <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em>(<em>t</em>) = −16<em>t</em><sup>2</sup> + 96<em>t</em></span>.
What is the rocket’s height <span class="math inline">3</span> seconds
after launch?</p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>Since time is the input, we know we
need to input <span class="math inline"><em>t</em> = 3</span> into our
function model: <span
class="math display"><em>h</em>(3) = −16(3)<sup>2</sup> + 96(3) = 144</span>
Of course, “<span class="math inline"><em>h</em>(3) = 144</span>” is not
a very good answer to the question asked; if you asked someone what the
rocket’s height would be and they answered “<span
class="math inline"><em>h</em>(3) = 144</span>” you’d probably find that
a weird way of answering your question! Interpreting the function to
answer the question in a reasonable way, we would say something like
this: “the height of the rocket <span class="math inline">3</span>
seconds after launch will be <span class="math inline">144</span>
feet.”</p>
</div>
<p>In both of the examples, we knew the input and used our model to get
the output. That is usually the way we want our mathematical models to
work. It only makes sense that we would want functions set up to take as
input the information we are most likely to start with, and give as
output the information we are seeking. However, it doesn’t always work
that way!<br />
Returning to our pool example, suppose we want to know how long it will
take to completely pump the water out of the pool? In other words, we
want to know when the volume of the pool reaches zero. So we know the
volume (the function’s output) and want to know the time (the function’s
input). Even though this is kind of backwards from the way we set up our
function, we can still figure this out. Here, we know the volume
(output) needs to be zero, so we plug in <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>t</em>) = 0</span> for the
output:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}
	f(t)&amp;=7200-20t\\
	0&amp;=7200-20t
\end{aligned}$$</span></p>
<p>and then solve the equation we get using algebra:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}
	20t&amp;=7200\\
	t&amp;=360
\end{aligned}$$</span></p>
<p>So, the time when we reach a volume of <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>t</em>) = 0</span> gallons is <span
class="math inline"><em>t</em> = 360</span> minutes. So we might say
“the pool will be empty after <span class="math inline">360</span>
minutes of pumping.” Even better, since the amount of time is longer
than we usually measure in minutes, we might convert this to hours.
Since there are 60 minutes per hour, there are 360 = 6 hours here, so an
even better answer might be “the pool will be emptied after 6 hours of
pumping”.</p>

<span class="math inline">846</span> kilowatt hours of electricity.”</p>
</div>
<p>Since function formulas are set up to give an output when you plug in
an input, when we do the opposite we always end up with an equation to
solve. Sometimes, as in the preceding example, we can do this
effectively with algebra. Other times, as in the following example, we
may need to call on graphical solution.</p>
<div id="FunctionsasModelsExample5" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 4.32</strong>. Suppose that the height of a toy
rocket in feet <span class="math inline"><em>t</em></span> seconds after
it is launched is given by the function <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em>(<em>t</em>) = −16<em>t</em><sup>2</sup> + 96<em>t</em></span>.
When is the rocket <span class="math inline">100</span> feet above the
ground (rounded to two decimal places if necessary)?</p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>We know the height (output) we want,
so we plug in <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em>(<em>t</em>) = 100</span> to get the
equation: <span
class="math display">100 = −16<em>t</em><sup>2</sup> + 96<em>t</em></span>
Now, if we use the standard window, we don’t wind up with a very helpful
view of this graph. What window should be use? We know something about
the equation we are trying to solve here; we know that the input
represents time since launch, and the output represents height of the
toy rocket. This gives us good hints about how to adjust out
window.<br />
For the input values, we are looking at values that might make sense for
the time when the rocket is at <span class="math inline">100</span>
feet. Now, we don’t know when this actually happens, of course, but we
do have some sense of what is reasonable. Certainly the rocket can’t
possibly have been at <span class="math inline">100</span> feet before
it was launched, so it makes no sense to look at input values less than
zero. How long might it take for the rocket to hit <span
class="math inline">100</span> feet? We can make a reasonable guess
(knowing that if the graph doesn’t look reasonable based on this guess
we can always change it.) Let’s say we guess 3 seconds.<br />
For the output window, we know we are looking for a height of <span
class="math inline">100</span> feet, which tells us we certainly want to
have a window that includes <span class="math inline">100</span>. Since
we are talking about shooting a rocket off the ground, it seems
reasonable to look at heights from <span class="math inline">0</span> to
a bit above <span class="math inline">100</span>, say <span
class="math inline">125</span>.<br />
So, we set our window to be:</p>
<figure>
<img src="Sections/FunctionsasModelsImages/Figure01.png" />
<figcaption>Window Settings</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Giving the resulting graph:</p>
<figure>
<img src="Sections/FunctionsasModelsImages/Figure02.png" />
<figcaption>Graph for <span
class="math inline"><em>Y</em><sub>1</sub> = −16<em>x</em><sup>2</sup> + 96<em>x</em></span>
and <span
class="math inline"><em>Y</em><sub>2</sub> = 100</span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Which, using graphical solution, gives us the solution <span
class="math inline"><em>t</em> = 1.34</span>: the rocket reaches <span
class="math inline">100</span> feet above the ground <span
class="math inline">1.34</span> seconds after launch.<br />
Now, we are not done! This model represents the flight of a toy rocket.
We’ve found then it hits <span class="math inline">100</span> feet on
the way up, but common sense tells us that it will also hit <span
class="math inline">100</span> on the way down, which we do not see in
our graph. It must be that the rocket falls to <span
class="math inline">100</span> feet some time after <span
class="math inline">3</span> seconds as well, so we need to extend our
input (X) maximum to see this. We can also tell from looking at our
graph that the rocket actually goes higher than <span
class="math inline">125</span> feet, so we may want to increase the
output (Y) maximum as well – though this is not really necessary to
solve the equation, doing so may make us feel better about the graph
we’re using.<br />
So, adjusting out window out a ways, such as:</p>
<figure>
<img src="Sections/FunctionsasModelsImages/Figure03.png" />
<figcaption>Adjusting Window Settings</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We get a new view of the graph:</p>
<figure>
<img src="Sections/FunctionsasModelsImages/Figure04.png" />
<figcaption>Graph for <span
class="math inline"><em>Y</em><sub>1</sub> = −16<em>x</em><sup>2</sup> + 96<em>x</em></span>
and <span
class="math inline"><em>Y</em><sub>2</sub> = 100</span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>And solving for that second intersection we get <span
class="math inline"><em>t</em> = 4.66</span><br />
So we conclude that the rocket is <span class="math inline">100</span>
feet above the ground <span class="math inline">1.34</span> seconds
after launch on the way up, and <span class="math inline">4.66</span>
seconds after launch on the way down.</p>
</div>
<p>Having a mathematical model actually makes graphical solution easier!
In this example, it both helped us figure out an appropriate window, and
also tipped us off that the one intersection we say in our first window
wasn’t the only solution.<br />
Don’t worry about picking precisely the right window with these types of
problems; there is no absolutely right window. Example <a
href="#FunctionsasModelsExample5" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="FunctionsasModelsExample5">4.32</a> could have been done
just as well with some different window choices. How did we know to try
a max of 3 seconds on the first try, as opposed to 5 seconds or 2
seconds? We didn’t! It was just a reasonable thing to try as a first
attempt. Your goal should be to make a reasonable, educated guess, and
if that guess turns out not to fit what the facts should be, to adjust
it. But you are not guessing blindly when you have a mathematical model;
the meaning of the model can and should give you hints.</p>
<h3 id="interpreting-function-notation">Interpreting Function
Notation</h3>
<p>If you are given information about a function used in a mathematical
model, you do not necessarily need to know the formula or rule for that
function in order to interpret that information. It is possible, and
desirable, to translate between function notation and interpretations,
regardless of whether we have a formula.<br />
For example, suppose you are told that the function <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>t</em>)</span> gives the volume of
water (in gallons) in a pool as a function of time in minutes since we
began pumping water out of the pool, and suppose you are also told <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(10) = 7000</span>. You do not need the
formula to interpret what that means!<br />
You know that volume of water is a function of time, and so that means
time is the input and water is the output (because it is always “output
is a function of input”.)<br />
You also know that function notation is always “<span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>i</em><em>n</em><em>p</em><em>u</em><em>t</em>) = <em>o</em><em>u</em><em>t</em><em>p</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></span>”.
So:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$f\left(\underbrace{10}_{input}
\right)=\underbrace{7000}_{output}$$</span></p>
<p>So <span class="math inline">10</span> in the input and input is
time, so that must mean “10 minutes”. Likewise, <span
class="math inline">7000</span> is the output and output is volume of
water, so that must mean “7000 gallons”. Putting these facts together,
we can interpret that as saying “when time is 10 minutes, the volume of
water is 7000 gallons”. Since that’s kind of an awkward way of saying
it, though, we might want to rephrase that a little more naturally as
something like:</p>
<div class="center">
<p>“after 10 minutes of pumping, 7000 gallons of water is left in the
pool”.</p>
</div>
<p>We can go the other way too. Suppose you know that there are 4800
gallons of water left after 2 hours (120 minutes). Time is the input, so
the input is 120. Volume is the output, so the output is 4800 gallons.
So, following the format <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>i</em><em>n</em><em>p</em><em>u</em><em>t</em>) = <em>o</em><em>u</em><em>t</em><em>p</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></span>
we can write this in function notation as:</p>
<p><span class="math display"><em>f</em>(120) = 4800.</span></p>
<div id="FunctionsasModelsExample6" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 4.33</strong>. The amount of yeast (in teaspoons)
needed for bread dough is a function of the amount of dough being made
(in pounds). Interpret <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(4) = 6</span></p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>“Yeast is a function of dough” here,
so yeast is the output and dough is the input. Also, “<span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(4) = 6</span>” so <span
class="math inline">6</span> is the output value and <span
class="math inline">4</span> is the input value.<br />
Putting this together means we have <span class="math inline">4</span>
pounds of dough and <span class="math inline">6</span> teaspoons of
yeast. Phrasing this in a reasonable way gives an answer something like
“you need 6 teaspoons of yeast to make 4 pounds of dough”.</p>
</div>
<div id="FunctionsasModelsExample7" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 4.34</strong>. A realtor’s commission is a function
of the selling price of the real estate sold. Suppose the realtor

notation. Assume the function’s name is <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>“Commission is a function of selling

Also,<span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>i</em><em>n</em><em>p</em><em>u</em><em>t</em>) = <em>o</em><em>u</em><em>t</em><em>p</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></span>,
so following this format we would write <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(160, 000) = 4, 800</span>.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="relevant-domain-and-range">Relevant Domain and Range</h3>
<p>We have previously defined domain to be the set of all the inputs for
a function. Most of the functions we are interested in for this course
involve numerical values, and as we’ve seen the domain for these
functions will usually be all real numbers (except where we need to
restrict the domain to avoid dividing by zero or taking the square root
of a negative.)<br />
So, for example, the domain of the function</p>
<p><span
class="math display"><em>f</em>(<em>t</em>) = 7200 − 20<em>t</em></span></p>
<p>would be all real numbers, since we can plug in any real number for
<span class="math inline"><em>t</em></span>, evaluate the result, and
get one and only one output. So, for examples, <span
class="math inline"><em>t</em> = 0</span>, <span
class="math inline"><em>t</em> = 120</span>, <span
class="math inline"><em>t</em> = 5, 000, 000, 000</span>, and <span
class="math inline"><em>t</em> = −317, 432</span> would all be in the
domain of this function, since these are all real numbers which can be
substituted into the formula and give one and only one output as a
result.<br />
When we are looking at functions as purely abstract things, our only
concern is whether or not we get a single output for a given input. When
we are using functions as mathematical models, though, that’s not all
that we care about. The function mentioned above you no doubt will
recognize as the pool-draining function we’ve been using in this
chapter. In that model, <span class="math inline"><em>t</em></span> is
not just the value you input – it actually represents something.
Plugging in <span class="math inline"><em>t</em> = 0</span> means that
we are looking at what happens when no time has passed, when the pump is
just first turned on. Plugging in <span
class="math inline"><em>t</em> = 120</span> means that we are looking at
what happens after <span class="math inline">120</span> minutes.<br />
And so plugging in <span
class="math inline"><em>t</em> = 5, 000, 000, 000</span> means that we
are looking at what happens after the pump has been running for five
billion minutes. This poses no problem with the formula – we can plug
that in and evaluate the result just fine – but does that actually make
any sense? Does <span class="math inline"><em>t</em> = −317, 432</span>
really make any sense? Would we really plug this in to use our model to
find how much water was in the pool <span
class="math inline">317, 432</span> minutes before the pump is turned
on? Again, there’s no problem doing the calculation – but do we really
expect that calculation to tell us anything worthwhile?<br />
In the context of pumping water out of the pool, it really only makes
sense to look at times between when the pump is first switched on and
when the pool is completely drained. The pump is switched on at time
<span class="math inline"><em>t</em> = 0</span> and, we calculated
earlier in this section, the pool is fully drained at time <span
class="math inline"><em>t</em> = 360</span>.<br />
So realistically speaking, the domain for the function in this
mathematical model would be all real numbers between <span
class="math inline">0</span> and <span class="math inline">360</span>
inclusive, which we would write as</p>
<p><span class="math display">{<em>t</em>|0 ≤ <em>t</em> ≤ 360} OR
[0, 360]</span></p>
<p>So, we really have two different “domains” for this function. The
domain in the abstract sense is all real numbers, because any real
number can be input into the function and give one and only one output.
When we say “domain” in mathematics, this is what we are talking
about.<br />
The domain in the sense of things that we actually would meaningfully
input into this model, though, is this more limited one. We call this
the relevant domain. So, for the function <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>t</em>) = 7200 − 20<em>t</em></span>
the domain is all real numbers. For this function within the
mathematical model we are discussing, the relevant domain is all real
numbers from <span class="math inline">0</span> to <span
class="math inline">360</span> inclusive.<br />
We do something similar with range. The range is the set of all outputs
for the function. We didn’t spend much time finding function’s ranges,
because that really requires more advanced algebra tools. But the
relevant range for a given mathematical model is often easier to
determine. In our swimming pool example, the output represents the
gallons of water in the pool. We know that the pool starts with <span
class="math inline">7200</span> gallons and we are draining it, so we
would expect that any volume between <span class="math inline">0</span>
and <span class="math inline">7200</span> gallons would be a reasonable
output to get. So the relevant range would be</p>
<p><span
class="math display">{<em>f</em>(<em>t</em>)|0 ≤ <em>f</em>(<em>t</em>) ≤ 7200}
OR [0, 7200]</span></p>
<p>We won’t worry about what the range of this function is in the
abstract sense here, other than to note that it would include plenty of
values that would make no sense as the volume of water in the pool. For
example, if you solve the equation <span
class="math inline">−2, 000, 000 = 7200 − 20<em>t</em></span> you get an
answer, so <span class="math inline">−2, 000, 000</span> would be in the
range of this function, since solving this equation shows that it is
possible to get <span class="math inline">−2, 000, 000</span> as an
output. But it certainly it makes no sense to ask when there are
negative two million gallons of water in the pool.<br />
In the pool-draining example it is pretty clear what the relevant domain
and relevant range must be. The action starts when the pump is turned on
and ends when the pool is drained, and that determines the relevant
domain and relevant range. This is not always so clear cut; sometimes
the line between what would be reasonable and what wouldn’t is fuzzy,
and we have to accept some ambiguity. The following example will
illustrate:</p>
<div id="FunctionsasModelsExample8" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 4.35</strong>. The speed limit on the Pennsylvania
Turnpike is <span class="math inline">65</span> mph. The fine for
speeding as a function of how fast you were going is given by the
function <span

<ol>
<li><p>Regarded as an abstract function, what is the domain of <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>s</em>)</span>?</p></li>

</ol>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Any real number could be input into this formula to get one and
only one output. So the domain is all real numbers.</p></li>
<li><p>Since fine is a function of speed, the input is speed and the
output is the fine. So, the relevant domain would consist of all
possible speeds you could be going when caught speeding. Since the speed
limit is <span class="math inline">65</span> mph, you could not be
caught speeding unless your speed was at least <span
class="math inline">65</span> mph. Realistically, though, you almost
certainly wouldn’t get a ticket for doing, say <span
class="math inline">66</span> or <span class="math inline">67</span>
mph. But it’s not really possible to say exactly where the cut off is.
It might be reasonable to use a lower limit of <span
class="math inline">68</span> or <span class="math inline">70</span>
mph, or to just keep it simple and use a lower limit of <span
class="math inline">65</span> mph anyway, since even though you’re not
likely to be stopped for speeding going slightly over 65, you could be.
We’ll use a lower limit of 65.<br />
At the upper end, clearly there are some speeds that you could not
possibly reach. I think it’s pretty clear for example that no one will
get a ticket for going <span class="math inline">20, 000</span> mph!
Even <span class="math inline">200</span> mph is not a realistic
possibility. But is <span class="math inline">90</span> mph possible?
Well, not in my car, but yes it is possible that a car could be going
that fast. <span class="math inline">100</span> mph? That’s pushing it,
but is it possible? Sure. <span class="math inline">110</span> mph?
Unlikely, but not out of the question. What is the absolute upper limit?
It’s really not possible to say. Clearly, the relevant domain has some
upper limit, and it’s probably somewhere in the low <span
class="math inline">100</span>’s, but it’s impossible to say exactly
where it is. We’ll use an upper limit of <span
class="math inline">125</span> mph.<br />
Putting this all together, we get a relevant domain of <span
class="math inline">{<em>s</em>|65 &lt; <em>s</em> ≤ 125}</span> or
<span class="math inline">(65, 125]</span>. This is a good answer – but
it is not the only possible good answer. We did not include 65 since
going exactly 65 would not be speeding, but it would still not be
entirely unreasonable to include it and give the relevant domain as
<span class="math inline">{<em>s</em>|65 ≤ <em>s</em> ≤ 125}</span> or
<span class="math inline">[65, 125]</span>. Also, as we discussed, a
different lower or upper limit could be used. It would also be
reasonable to give an answer of <span
class="math inline">{<em>s</em>|67 ≤ <em>s</em> ≤ 120}</span> or <span
class="math inline">[67, 120]</span> for example. As long as the lower
and upper bounds for the relevant domain make sense as lower and upper
bounds for how fast you could be going when stopped for speeding, you’ve
got a reasonable relevant domain.<br />
The relevant range has the same issues – there is not a single correct
answer for this. But, the fine does depend on speed, so our relevant
range should be consistent with the speeds we included in our relevant
domain. The fine goes up with higher speeds, so the lowest fine would be
the fine based on the lowest speed, and the highest fine would be based
on the highest speed. Since we used <span
class="math inline"><em>s</em> = 65</span> as the lower limit for
speeds, we should use <span class="math inline">$75</span> as the lower
limit for fines, since <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(65) = 75 + 5(65 − 65) = 75</span> would
be the fine for that speed. For the upper limit of <span
class="math inline"><em>s</em> = 125</span>, the fine would be <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(125) = 75 + 5(125 − 65) = 375</span>
dollars. So our relevant range would be <span
class="math inline">{<em>f</em>(<em>s</em>)|75 ≤ <em>s</em> ≤ 375}</span>
or <span class="math inline">[75, 375]</span>. (If we used a different
relevant domain, we would set up the relevant range based on
that.)</p></li>

rocket returns to the ground. To find this we would need to plug in
<span class="math inline"><em>h</em>(<em>t</em>) = 0</span> into the
function, and then solve <span
class="math display">−16<em>t</em><sup>2</sup> + 96<em>t</em> = 0</span>
Solving this equation with algebra is beyond our present abilities, but
we can solve this graphically. Doing so, we find that the rocket returns
to the ground at time <span class="math inline"><em>t</em> = 6</span>
seconds after launch.<br />
So, our relevant domain is <span
class="math inline">{<em>t</em>|0 ≤ <em>t</em> ≤ 6}</span> or <span
class="math inline">[0, 6]</span>. There is no ambiguity about this –
this is really the only reasonable relevant domain to use.<br />
Since height is the output, the relevant range would be based on the
heights the rocket actually reaches. In this case we cannot just base
this on the upper and lower limits of our domain because the height is
not always increasing – the rocket hits its maximum height during its
journey.<br />
We can find this maximum using the graphing calculator’s built-in
programs, following these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Create the graph in an appropriate window, in which the maximum
occurs.</p></li>
<li><p>Hit “2nd” “TRACE” (i.e. “CALC”) <span
class="math inline">→</span> “4: maximum” –&gt; “ENTER”</p></li>
<li><p>For “Left Bound?” choose any X-value to the left of the maximum
and hit “ENTER”</p></li>
<li><p>For “Right Bound?” choose any X-value to the right of the maximum
and hit “ENTER”</p></li>
<li><p>For “Guess?” move the blob reasonably close to the maximum if
there is more than one place where the graph reaches a peak, otherwise
just hit “ENTER”</p></li>
<li><p>The calculator will find the maximum.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Since the maximum height is <span class="math inline">144</span>
feet, the relevant range is <span
class="math inline">{<em>h</em>(<em>t</em>)|0 ≤ <em>h</em>(<em>t</em>) ≤ 144}</span>,
or <span class="math inline">[0, 144]</span>.</p>

<h2 id="ImplicitFunctions">Implicit Functions</h2>
<p>Normally we want our function formulas to be set up so that when we
plug in an input value, we simply evaluate the result to get the
corresponding output value. For example, the relationship between
Fahrenheit and Celsius temperature can be described with the formula</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$F=\frac{9}{5}C+32$$</span></p>
<p>where as you would expect <span class="math inline"><em>F</em></span>
is the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit and <span
class="math inline"><em>C</em></span> is the temperature in degrees
Celsius. How does this formula work as a function? Is <span
class="math inline"><em>F</em></span> a function of <span
class="math inline"><em>C</em></span>? Is <span
class="math inline"><em>C</em></span> as function of <span
class="math inline"><em>F</em></span>? Does it work both ways? Does it
work either way?</p>
<h3 id="implicit-functions">Implicit Functions</h3>
<p>Now, we can treat the temperature in Fahrenheit as a function of
temperature in Celsius (since each Fahrenheit temperature corresponds to
one and only one Celsius temperature). Or we can treat Celsius as a
function of Fahrenheit (since each Celsius temperature corresponds to
one and only one Fahrenheit temperature). And either way, we can use
this formula. If you input a value for <span
class="math inline"><em>C</em></span> into the formula, you can evaluate
the result and get the corresponding value of <span
class="math inline"><em>F</em></span>. And, if you input a value of
<span class="math inline"><em>F</em></span>, you can then solve the
result to get the corresponding value of <span
class="math inline"><em>C</em></span>. Either way works.<br />
However, one way works more nicely than the other. If you treat <span
class="math inline"><em>C</em></span> as the input, then the formula is
perfectly set up to give you <span class="math inline"><em>F</em></span>
as the output. We say that this equation defines <span
class="math inline"><em>F</em></span> <strong>explicitly</strong> as a
function of <span class="math inline"><em>C</em></span>. We can even
give this function a name and write it in function notation as <span
class="math inline">$f(C)=\frac{9}{5}C+32$</span>.<br />
If we treat <span class="math inline"><em>F</em></span> as the input,
then we have to work through the algebra to figure out what the output
value of <span class="math inline"><em>C</em></span> would be. It can be
done, but it is certainly not anywhere near as convenient as it was the
other way around. And, since we don’t have an expression which gives us
<span class="math inline"><em>C</em></span> explicitly, we can’t use
function notation with the formula as given. In this situation, where a
function relationship exists but the formula is set up so that we have
to solve for the output value when an input is plugged in, we say that
the equation defines <span class="math inline"><em>C</em></span>
<strong>implicitly</strong> as a function of <span
class="math inline"><em>F</em></span>.<br />
When a formula defines a function explicitly, that is the more natural
way to handle the relationship the formula describes. There are,
however, cases where we will have good reason to do things the other way
around.</p>
<div id="ImplicitFunctionsExample1" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 4.37</strong>. The relationship between my natural
gas bill (in dollars) and the amount of gas I use (in therms) is given

<span class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> is my bill and <span

<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>My bill is a function of my usage

(since if I use more I should be billed more and if I use less I should
be billed less – this fits with common sense, and also can be seen from
the formula, since a different usage would give a different bill from
this formula.)<br />
The formula is set up to conveniently take <span
class="math inline"><em>t</em></span> as the input and give <span
class="math inline"><em>B</em></span> as the output. So it is more
natural to treat my bill as a function of my usage. In other words, this

implicitly gives my usage as a function of my bill.<br />
This view also agrees with how things actually happen; you I use a
certain amount of gas and then the utility calculates my bill based on
this. So the formula is written in a way that agrees with how things are
actually likely to be done.</p>

</div>
<h3 id="rewriting-implicit-functions-in-explicit-form">Rewriting
Implicit Functions in Explicit Form</h3>
<p>Sometimes we have an equation that does not define any function
explicitly, but nonetheless expresses a relationship between quantities.
For example, suppose a refiner is making <span
class="math inline">500</span> gallons of a fuel blend of gasoline and
ethanol. If we let <span class="math inline"><em>G</em></span> represent
the amount of gasoline (in gallons) and let <span
class="math inline"><em>E</em></span> represent that amount of ethanol
(in gallons), we can see that</p>
<p><span class="math display"><em>G</em> + <em>E</em> = 500.</span></p>
<p>Is the amount of gasoline a function of the amount of ethanol? Yes!
We can see this both from common sense (if I know how much ethanol was
used, there is only one possible amount of gasoline that could have been
used to bring the total to 500 gallons), and from algebra (if you plug
in any given value for <span class="math inline"><em>E</em></span> you
can solve the equation to get one and only one value for <span
class="math inline"><em>G</em></span>.<br />
Is the amount of ethanol a function of the amount of gasoline? Again,
the answer is yes, for pretty much exactly the same reasons.<br />
This formula, though, does not define either of these functions
explicitly. Whether we input gasoline or ethanol, we will have to do
some algebra to get the other quantity. We can however create an
explicit function from this formula by solving for whichever variable we
want to be output in terms of the variable we want to be input.<br />
Suppose we want to treat the amount of ethanol as a function of the
amount of gasoline. So we want a formula that is set up to give <span
class="math inline"><em>E</em></span> explicitly – a formula like
this:</p>
<p><span
class="math display"><em>E</em> = <em>s</em><em>o</em><em>m</em><em>e</em><em>t</em><em>h</em><em>i</em><em>n</em><em>g</em>
<em>b</em><em>a</em><em>s</em><em>e</em><em>d</em> <em>o</em><em>n</em>
<em>G</em></span></p>
<p>So we start with the given equation, and solve it for <span
class="math inline"><em>E</em></span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}
	G+E&amp;=500\\
	E&amp;=500-G
\end{aligned}$$</span></p>
<p>So we now have a formula that gives ethanol as a function of gasoline
explicitly!<br />
It’s not hard to see that we could also get gasoline as a function of
ethanol explicitly with the formula <span
class="math inline"><em>G</em> = 500 − <em>E</em></span>.</p>
<div id="ImplicitFunctionsExample4" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 4.40</strong>. The equation <span

implicitly defines <span class="math inline"><em>y</em></span> as a
function of <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>. Rewrite this

<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>First, to find <span

Now to find <span class="math inline"><em>y</em></span> as a function of

class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}

<span class="math inline">$y=g(x)=\frac{6-4y}{3}$</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>In this last example we were told that the equation defined functions
implicitly. What if we aren’t told that? How can we tell whether or not
an equation contains an implicit function?<br />
When the equation comes from a mathematical model, the meaning of the
model often tells us this. In the gasoline-ethanol example, even without
seeing the formula you could have figured that each would have to be a
function of the other. In Example <a href="#ImplicitFunctionsExample3"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="ImplicitFunctionsExample3">4.39</a> it made sense that
time would not be a function of height because, unless we assume the
baseball is thrown so hard that it escapes the Earth’s gravitation and
continues on to explore the universe, the ball will both go up and come
down.<br />
But we can’t always rely on this. Sometimes we don’t know the purpose
behind the equation we are working with, and sometimes the equation
models something we don’t know enough about to say whether or not a
function exists. How can we tell in those cases?<br />
We can determine whether an equation implicitly defines a function by
trying to explicitly find a formula for the function. In the previous
example (Example <a href="#ImplicitFunctionsExample4"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="ImplicitFunctionsExample4">4.40</a> you could have seen
that <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> was a function of <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em></span> by solving for <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> in terms of <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em></span>. Because you can algebraically
modify the equation to be an explicit function, you know the function
exists.</p>

<p><strong>Example 4.41</strong>. Suppose <span
class="math inline">$\frac{t-3}{2}=\frac{p+4}{5}$</span>. Is <span

<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>If we can solve for <span

		5t-15&amp;=2p+8\\
		5t&amp;=2p+23\\

class="math inline"><em>p</em></span> from this equation, we can
conclude that <span class="math inline"><em>t</em></span> is indeed a

</div>
<p>We could also have found that <span
class="math inline"><em>p</em></span> is a function of <span
class="math inline"><em>t</em></span> in this example in much the same
way. Since that’s pretty similar we won’t show the work for that here,
but you may want to try to work that through yourself now.</p>
<div id="ImplicitFunctionsExample6" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 4.42</strong>. Suppose <span
class="math inline">3<em>h</em> = <em>k</em><sup>2</sup> − 11</span>. Is
<span class="math inline"><em>h</em></span> a function of <span

<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>We try to solve for <span

easy: <span class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}
		3h&amp;=k^2-11\\
		h&amp;=\frac{k^2-11}{3}
	
\end{aligned}$$</span> So since we could get an explicit formula for

On the other hand, we run into trouble when we try to solve for <span

class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}
		3h&amp;=k^2-11\\
		3h+11&amp;=k^2\\
		k^2&amp;=3h+11
	
\end{aligned}$$</span> To get rid of the exponent, we need to take the
square root of both sides of this equation. However, remember that every
positive number has two square roots - one positive and one negative. So
we get: <span class="math display">$$k=\sqrt{3h+11} \text{    OR    }
k=-\sqrt{3h+11}$$</span> This equation can be written compactly as:
<span class="math display">$$k=\pm \sqrt{3h+11}$$</span> The symbol
“<span class="math inline">±</span>” is used to indicate “plus or
minus”. Now, while this is a formula for <span
class="math inline"><em>k</em></span>, it is a formula that gives two
different results. So, for a given input value of <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em></span>, this formula can give two
different outputs for <span class="math inline"><em>k</em></span>. For
this reason, we can conclude that <span
class="math inline"><em>k</em></span> is not a function of <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em></span>.</p>
</div>
<p>So, in summary, if we can find an explicit formula (one that does not
involve anything like “<span class="math inline">±</span>” which gives
multiple answers), we have a function. If we try to solve and end up
with an ambiguous formula (such as the one we just found), we do not
have a function.<br />
There might be times, though, where you try to solve for a variable and
are simply unable to do it. Returning to Example <a
href="#ImplicitFunctionsExample3" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="ImplicitFunctionsExample3">4.39</a>, where we had the
formula <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em> = −4.9<em>t</em><sup>2</sup> + 30<em>t</em></span>,
we determined based on the meaning of the formula that <span
class="math inline"><em>t</em></span> is not a function of <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em></span>. If you try to solve this equation
for <span class="math inline"><em>t</em></span> in terms of <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em></span> you probably won’t meet with much
success. Could you also conclude that it is not a function from an
inability to solve for <span
class="math inline"><em>t</em></span>?<br />
The answer is emphatically NO! Just because you can’t solve an equation
with the algebra tools you’ve learned so far, does not necessarily mean
it can’t be done. “I can’t do it” doesn’t mean “it can’t be done!” By
itself, inability to solve does not tell you one way or the other
whether or not the relationship is a function. In the case of Example <a
href="#ImplicitFunctionsExample3" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="ImplicitFunctionsExample3">4.39</a>, we can’t solve for
<span class="math inline"><em>t</em></span> and we know for other
reasons that <span class="math inline"><em>t</em></span> is not a
function of <span class="math inline"><em>h</em></span>.<br />
But other times we may not be able to solve and the relationship may
still be a function. For example, the equation <span
class="math inline"><em>p</em> − 10 = 2<sup><em>t</em></sup></span>
implicitly defines <span class="math inline"><em>p</em></span> as a
function of <span class="math inline"><em>t</em></span> (that’s not hard
to show), but it also defines <span
class="math inline"><em>t</em></span> as a function of <span
class="math inline"><em>p</em></span> (though solving this equation for
<span class="math inline"><em>t</em></span> requires tools that lie far
beyond the scope of this course.) To be able to say that <span
class="math inline"><em>t</em></span> is a function of <span
class="math inline"><em>p</em></span> here would require either those
more advanced tools, or knowing something about what <span
class="math inline"><em>p</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>t</em></span> represent.<br />
In the exercises, you won’t be given any questions where whether or not
the relationship is a function cannot be determined. In all the problems
you will see in this course, it will be possible to tell whether or not
the relationship is a function either using algebra we are already
familiar with, or by thinking about what the variables in the equation
represent.<br />

class="math inline">$F=\frac{9}{5}C+32$</span> gives Fahrenheit
explicitly as a function of Celsius. We also noted that this formula
also gives Celsius as a function of Fahrenheit <u>implicitly</u>.<br />
If we want to input Celsius and get Fahrenheit as an output we are fine
with the formula as it is, but if we want to go the other way this
formula makes that possible, but tedious. It is almost always more
convenient to have a formula that gives the function you want
<u>explicitly</u>. We can accomplish this by solving for the output
variable we want.</p>

<h2 id="RatesofChange">Rates of Change</h2>
<p>The ancient Greek philosopher Heraclitus is best known for saying
“the only constant is change”. This is a quote that gets used a lot,
mainly because it applies to so many situations. There aren’t many
things in this world that aren’t in some way changing, and so change is
an important consideration in the mathematical models we use to describe
this world.<br />
In the functions we’ve looked at so far, it’s almost always been true
that when you change the input value, the output value also changes.
This is not a requirement for a function; a constant function like <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = 42</span> (which always
give the exact same output no matter what you input) is a perfectly good
function. But constant functions aren’t really all that useful or
interesting. Change is everywhere in the world, and so the functions we
are likely to find useful to mathematically model the world will
naturally be functions which reflect those changes.<br />
In this section, we’ll discuss rates of change in mathematical
models.</p>
<h3 id="average-rates-of-change">Average Rates of Change</h3>
<p>Suppose you are driving down the highway in a car. We can look at the
distance you’ve travelled as a function of the time you’ve been driving.
Let’s also suppose we know the following:</p>
<div class="center">
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align: center;">Time (Hours)</th>
<th style="text-align: center;">Distance Traveled (miles)</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;">0</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;">1</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">58</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<p>It’s no surprise that the distance you’ve traveled has changed as
time goes by; that’s kind of the point of driving down the highway in a
car! You’re moving.<br />
We know from experience that “moving” can happen at different rates.
Sometimes you move fast, sometimes you move slow. How fast were you
moving in the first hour of your trip? Well, common sense says that you
traveled 58 miles in one hour, so that means that your speed was 58
miles per hour.<br />
Now, common sense also tells us that this 58 miles per hour is not the
exact speed you were traveling at every single moment of that hour. When
you’re driving, of course you sometimes are going faster and sometimes
going slower. You may have sped up to pass or going down hill, and may
have slowed down in a construction zone, going up hill, or when you
noticed that police car with a radar gun pointed at you. Even if you had
the cruise control set at 58 for the entire hour, there would still be
some variation in your speed (since cruise control does not maintain a
perfectly constant speed). So, when we say you were going 58 miles per
hour, we understand that this is an average speed.<br />
Being a little more formal about this, we could write:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$average \text{ } speed = \frac{distance
\text{ } traveled}{time \text{ } elapsed} = \frac{58 \text{ } miles}{1
\text{ } hour} = 58 \text{ } miles \text{ } per \text{ }
hour$$</span></p>
<p>Now, this was an average speed we could calculate in our heads just
using common sense. If we weren’t looking at just the first hour or the
trip we might not be able to do the calculation quite so simply, but we
can adapt. Suppose we want to calculate an average speed based on this
portion of your trip:</p>
<div class="center">
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align: center;">Time (Hours)</th>
<th style="text-align: center;">Distance Traveled (miles)</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;">1</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">58</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;">2.5</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">149.5</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<p>The distance traveled over this portion of the trip can be calculated
by subtracting <span class="math inline">149.5 − 58 = 91.5</span> miles.
The time elapsed could also be found by subtraction - - this portion of
the trip took <span class="math inline">2.5 − 1 = 1.5</span> hours.
Then:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$average \text{ } speed = \frac{distance
\text{ } traveled}{time \text{ } elapsed} = \frac{91.5 \text{ }
miles}{1.5 \text{ } hours} = 61 \text{ } miles \text{ } per \text{ }
hour$$</span></p>
<p>So, the average speed for this portion of the trip was 61 miles per
hour. Not surprisingly, this is a different average speed that what we
calculated for the first hour. It stands to reason that since your speed
varies, your average speed also will vary depending on what portion of
your trip we are looking at.<br />
Notice that in both cases, we essentially did the same thing. To find
the average speed (that is, the average rate of change in the distance
traveled as a function of time), we found the distance traveled (the
change in the output) by subtracting and divided it by the time elapsed
(the change in the input) which we also found by subtracting.<br />
We can generalize this as follows:</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><strong><u>The Average Rate of Change (“AROC”)
Formula</u></strong><br />
The average rate of change of <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>)</span> between <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em> = <em>a</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em> = <em>b</em></span> is <span
class="math display">$$AROC=\frac{\Delta output}{\Delta
input}=\frac{\Delta f(x)}{\Delta x}=\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}$$</span> (The
symbol <span class="math inline"><em>Δ</em></span> means “the change
in”.)</p>
</div>
<p>This formula just generalizes the speed example we were discussing
above (where the output was distance and input was time.) But it applies
to lots of other things other than speed - it can be used to find the
average rate of change for any function at all.</p>

<li><p>Following the formula, using the temperatures at midnight (i.e.
at time = 0) and 6 a.m. (i.e. at time = 6): <span
class="math display">$$AROC = \frac{\Delta temperature}{\Delta time} =
\frac{f(6)-f(0)}{6-0} = \frac{39-48}{6-0} = -1.5$$</span> So, between
midnight and 6 a.m. the temperature was changing at an average rate of
<span class="math inline">−1.5deg <em>F</em></span> per hour.
Equivalently, we could say it was dropping at average rate of <span
class="math inline">1.5deg <em>F</em></span> per hour (saying “dropping”
indicates direction and so eliminates the need for the negative
sign.)</p></li>
<li><p>Following the same approach: <span class="math display">$$AROC =
\frac{\Delta temperature}{\Delta time} = \frac{f(10)-f(6)}{10-6} =
\frac{48-39}{10-6} = 2.25$$</span> So, between 6 a.m. and 10 a.m. the

<li><p>Again: <span class="math display">$$AROC = \frac{\Delta
temperature}{\Delta time} = \frac{f(10)-f(0)}{10-0} = \frac{48-48}{10-0}

of the temperature was <span class="math inline">0deg <em>F</em></span>
per hour. Note that this does not mean that the temperature was not
changing! This average rate of change means that when you average out
all the changes the overall increases and decreases balance each other
out.</p></li>

<p>The notion of average rate of change can be applied to any function,

<h3 id="interpreting-average-rates-of-change">Interpreting Average Rates
of Change</h3>
<p>When we are talking about a car traveling down the highway, it’s not
much of a stretch to realize that the rate of change we are talking
about is a speed, and if the distance is in miles and time is in hours,
it’s fairly obvious that this speed would be measured in miles per hour.
Likewise, if temperature is in <span
class="math inline">deg <em>F</em></span> and time is in hours, it’s not
hard to see that this functions average rate of change would be measure
in <span class="math inline">deg <em>F</em></span> per hour.<br />
But sometimes we are looking at models where common sense isn’t so
reliable a guide, either because the model could be set up to work in
more than one way and we’re not <span class="math inline">100%</span>
sure about how it actually is set up, or because what we are modeling is
unfamiliar. How do we interpret and put units on average rates of change
then?<br />
Fortunately, there is always a clear pattern to the units, which can
help with interpretation. When we calculated that first speed, we
took</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$\frac{58 \text{ } miles}{1 \text{ }
hour}$$</span></p>
<p>and got an average speed of 58 miles per hour. Now, our attention was
mainly focused on the numbers. That 58 came from dividing <span
class="math inline">$\frac{58}{1}$</span>, but now notice the units. We
are dividing <span class="math inline">$\frac{miles}{hour}$</span> and
the units we end up with were miles per hour, which can also be written
as “miles/hour”. The fact that this looks like just another way of
writing the fraction is not a coincidence. Units for average rates of
change always work out this way!<br />
When we found the average rate of temperature change between midnight
and 6 a.m. we ended up with <span
class="math inline">$\frac{-9}{6}$</span> to get the number <span
class="math inline">−1.5</span>, but the units “<span
class="math inline">deg <em>F</em></span> per hour” came from the fact
that the numerator was a change of temperature in degrees Fahrenheit and
the denominator was a change of time in hours. It was this <span
class="math inline">$\frac{\deg F}{hour}$</span> that made the average
rate of change be measured in “<span
class="math inline">deg <em>F</em></span>/hour” or “<span
class="math inline">deg <em>F</em></span> per hour”.<br />
In general:</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><strong><u>Units of Average Rate of Change</u></strong><br />
The units of an average rate of change are always “output units/input
units”<br />
which can also be expressed as<br />
“output units per input unit”.</p>
</div>
<div id="RateofChangeExample3" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 4.46</strong>. As I drive down the highway, the
distance I’ve traveled is a function of the amount of gasoline I’ve
used. Some data for this function is given in the table below:</p>
<div class="center">

<thead>

<p>What is the average rate of change in this function between the two
points given in this table (rounded to one decimal place)? What are the
units? What does this average rate of change tell you in practical
terms?</p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>We are treating distance as a
function of gasoline, so distance is the output and gasoline is the
input. So, using the AROC formula we get: <span
class="math display">$$AROC = \frac{\Delta output}{\Delta input} =
\frac{\Delta distance}{\Delta gasoline} = \frac{255.8-108.6}{7.5-3.2} =
\frac{147.2}{4.3} = 34.2$$</span> The units are always “output units per
input unit” so this means the average rate of change is actually “34.2
miles per gallon”.<br />
The average rate of change tells us the rate at which distance is
changing as the amount of gas used changes. In other words, how far you
go versus how much gas you burn. It might not be easy to see what the
practical meaning is based just on that description though. The units
give us a clue though. Just saying “34.2 miles per gallon” gives a huge
hint that we are talking about my average gas mileage for this portion
of the trip.</p>
</div>
<p>As in this example, the units of the average rate of change often
give us a big hint about what the average rate of change actually
means.</p>
<div id="RateofChangeExample4" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 4.47</strong>. Mobile phones contain small amounts of
valuable metals, and increasingly phones are being recycled to reclaim
these materials. Suppose that the amount of silver (in kilograms) that a
recycler expects can be recovered is a function of the phones’ weight
(in tons).<br />
The recycler expects to recover 16.1 kilograms of silver from 5 tons of
used phones and 32.7 kilograms from 10 tons. Find the average rate of
change of this function (rounded to one decimal place) including the
appropriate units. What does this average rate of change tell you in a
practical sense?</p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>Silver is a function of phones, <span
class="math display">$$AROC = \frac{\Delta output}{\Delta input} =
\frac{\Delta silver}{\Delta phones} = \frac{32.7-16.1}{10-5} =
\frac{16.6}{5} = 3.32$$</span> the units are “output units per input
unit”, so using this and rounding we conclude that the average rate of
change is “3.3 kilograms of silver per ton of recycled phones”.<br />
To interpret this, we know that the amount of expected silver to be
recovered changes relative to the amount of phones, so this rate should
tell us on average how quickly we expect the amount of recovered silver
to be changing as more phones are processed. More helpfully, the units
give us a huge hint: The recycler expects, on average, that they will
recover 3.3 kilograms of silver per ton of recycled phones.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="constant-vs.-nonconstant-rates-of-change">Constant vs.
Nonconstant Rates of Change</h3>
<p>As we’ve emphasized already, what we are after here is the average
rate of change for functions. We need to always be clear that what we
have is only an average. If your average speed over the first hour of a
trip is 58 miles per hour, we all understand that this gives an
indication of how fast you were driving over the course of that hour
overall, but we all also understand that this does not mean that you
were driving 58 miles per hour the whole time, or even at any specific
time.<br />
It’s possible that your speed stayed pretty close to 58 mph the whole
time, but it’s also possible that you drove 95 mph for part of the hour
and were not moving at all during other parts of the hour (presumably
when you got pulled over for doing 95.) Either way, you could have ended
up with a 58 mph average speed. Likewise, it’s possible that, say, 17
minutes into the trip you were going 58, but it’s not at all unlikely
that at that specific time you were going faster or slower. All we know
is the average.<br />
Likewise, knowing that the average rate of change in temperature was
<span class="math inline">0deg <em>F</em></span> per hour from midnight
till 10 a.m. tells us something valuable about the overall change in
temperature, but it tells us nothing about whether the temperature
stayed fairly stable or bounced around a lot, and it tells us nothing
about the temperature at 3 a.m. or 7 a.m. or any other particular
time.<br />
It makes sense that our mathematical models can’t give us this
information. Finding an average speed or rate of temperature change only
requires us to know where things stood at the start and at the end of
period we’re looking at. We don’t need to know about how things varied
along the way. To know what was going on at some point in between
requires us to have a lot more information. Can you imagine how
complicated it would be to create a mathematical model to precisely
match up with everything that happens along the course of an hour’s
driving?<br />
In some special cases, though, we can know more. If the rate of change
is itself not changing (that is, if the rate of change is constant) then
we know what the rate of change was at any given time - it’s always the
same. This is a very special situation that certainly can’t be relied on
to happen with things like driving or temperatures, but when it does
occur, it certainly is a nice trait to have. We’ll close this chapter by
noting this and offering an example where this happens. We’ll have a lot
more to say about functions with constant rates of change in the
following chapter!</p>
<div id="RateofChangeExample5" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 4.48</strong>. The amount of a residential electric
bill (in dollars) is a function of the electricity used (in kilowatt
hours). The function is given by the formula <span
class="math inline"><em>A</em>(<em>x</em>) = 12.75 + 0.12<em>x</em></span>.
If my electric usage changes from 720 to 860 kilowatt hours, what will
the average rate of change of my electric bill be as that usage
increases? What if it then decreases from 860 kilowatt hours to 585
kilowatt hours? Does it seem likely that the rate of change will always
be the same?</p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span> To determine the change in usage
from <span class="math inline"><em>x</em> = 720</span> to <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em> = 860</span> kilowatt hours, we need to
know the amount of the bills for those usage levels.</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$A(720) = 12.75+0.12(720) = 99.15\\
		A(860) = 12.75+0.12(860) = 115.95$$</span></p>
<p>So the average rate of change is</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}
		AROC &amp;= \frac{\Delta bill}{\Delta usage} = \frac{\Delta A(x)}{\Delta
x}\\
		&amp;= \frac{A(860)-A(720)}{860-720} \\
		&amp;= \frac{115.95-99.15}{860-720} \\
		&amp;=\frac{16.80}{140}\\
		&amp;=0.12
	
\end{aligned}$$</span></p>
<p>So we would conclude that as usage changes from 720 to 860 kilowatt
hours, the bill changes at an average rate of <span
class="math inline">$0.12</span> per kilowatt hour.<br />
Calculating the bill for 585 kilowatt hours we get:</p>
<p><span
class="math display"><em>A</em>(585) = 12.75 + 0.12(585) = 82.95</span></p>
<p>And then:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}
		AROC &amp;= \frac{\Delta bill}{\Delta usage} = \frac{\Delta A(x)}{\Delta
x}\\
		&amp;= \frac{A(585)-A(860)}{585-860} \\
		&amp;= \frac{82.95-115.95}{585-860} \\
		&amp;=\frac{-33}{-260}\\
		&amp;=0.12
	
\end{aligned}$$</span></p>
<p>So as the usage goes from 860 to 585 kilowatt hours the average rate
of change is again <span class="math inline">$0.12</span> per kilowatt
hour.</p>
</div>
<p>The fact that these two average rates of change are the same could be
a coincidence, but there is reason to think something more might be
going on here. The rate of change is giving us a rate per kilowatt hour,
and it seems reasonable to suppose that the electric bill might be based
on some set price per kilowatt hour. (Of course, it might not be, too,
since there might be a discount or a surcharge for higher or lower usage
amounts.)<br />
Adding to this suspicion, though, is the fact that the average rate of
change <span class="math inline">0.12</span> appears in the function
formula. In fact, if you think through how you would go about
calculating an electric bill if there were a set price per kilowatt
hour, the given formula seems to match up with that pretty nicely.<br />
While we are not yet able to say for certain that this average rate of
change is in fact a constant rate of change, there seems to be good
reason to think it might be.</p>

<h1 id="linear-functions">Linear Functions</h1>
<h2 id="LinearFunctionsandSlope">Linear Functions and Their Slopes</h2>
<p>At the end of the last chapter, we took a look at functions in terms
of their average rates of change, and noted that some functions have
constant rates of change, while for others the rate of changes varies.
We also noted that there is huge difference between these two types of
functions.<br />
In this chapter we will focus our attention on those special functions
whose rates of change are always the same. We will see that there are
actually rather a lot of useful functions which have this special
property, and how knowing a function has a constant rate of change can
help in setting up mathematical models.</p>
<h3 id="linear-functions-and-slope">Linear Functions and Slope</h3>
<p>We’ll begin by defining our terms:</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><strong><u>Definition Linear Function</u></strong><br />
A function is called <strong>linear</strong> if and only if it has a
constant rate of change.<br />
The rate of change of a linear function is called its
<strong>slope</strong>.</p>
</div>
<p>In <a href="#RatesofChange" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="RatesofChange">4.6</a>, we looked at the average rates
of change for various functions, and noted that for most functions, the
rate of change is itself changing. For example, the rate of change for
the distance you travel on a trip as a function of time is your speed,
and your speed varies. So this would not be a linear function. Another
example we considered was temperature as a function of time, and we
noted the rate at which the temperature changes is not always the same,
and so that would also not be a linear function.<br />
On the other hand, we also looked at the amount of a residential
electric bill as a function of the electricity used, and noted that it
seemed reasonable that there would be a set cost per kilowatt-hour. If
that is indeed true, that would mean that the amount of the bill as a
function of electric usage has a constant rate of change, and therefore
is a linear function.<br />
If we have a linear function, knowing its constant rate of change (that
is, its slope) would seem to be pretty useful information. How can we
determine the slope? It turns out that we already know how! If everyone
working for a company makes the same hourly rate, and the average wage
is <span class="math inline">$12.50</span> per hour, then logically it
must be that everybody makes the same as the average – <span
class="math inline">$12.50</span> per hour. By the same sort of logic,
if a function always has the same rate of change, then that rate of
change must be the same as the average rate of change. So, if a function
is linear we can find its slope by finding its average rate of
change.<br />
Let’s make that official.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><strong><u>Formula: The Slope of a Linear Function</u></strong><br />
The slope of a linear function can be found using the formula:<br />
<span class="math display">$$slope = \frac{\Delta output}{\Delta input}
= \frac{\Delta f(x)}{\Delta x}=\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}$$</span> where
<span class="math inline"><em>a</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>b</em></span> are any two values in the domain
of <span class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>An example will illustrate this formula’s use.</p>
<div id="LinearFunctionsandSlopeExample1" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 5.1</strong>. Suppose <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>)</span> is a linear function,
and suppose <span class="math inline"><em>f</em>(1) = 3</span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(5) = 27</span>. Find its slope.</p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>We have two input-output pairs for
the function, so we can use them in the slope formula. If we choose
<span class="math inline"><em>a</em> = 1</span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>b</em> = 5</span>, we get: <span
class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}
		slope &amp;= \frac{\Delta output}{\Delta input} = \frac{\Delta
f(x)}{\Delta x}=\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}\\
		&amp;\\
		&amp;=\frac{f(5)-f(1)}{5-1}=\frac{27-3}{5-1}\\
		&amp;\\
		&amp;=\frac{24}{4}=6
	
\end{aligned}$$</span> (We usually choose <span
class="math inline"><em>a</em></span> to be the smaller value, but we
don’t have to. We’d have gotten the same result if we had let <span
class="math inline"><em>a</em> = 5</span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>b</em> = 1</span>).</p>
</div>
<p>When calculating average rates of change we often got different
averages depending on which input-output pairs we used. That happens
with non-linear functions. But this is not an issue when calculating
slope. Since the slope of a linear function is, by definition, a
constant rate of change, it will come out to be the same regardless of
which input-output pairs we use.</p>
<div id="LinearFunctionsandSlopeExample2" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 5.2</strong>. Suppose <span
class="math inline"><em>g</em></span> is a linear function, some of
whose inputs and corresponding outputs are given in the following table.
Find the slope.</p>
<div class="center">

</table>
</div>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>We have more input-output pairs than
we actually need here. To use the formula we only need two. So we can
choose any two to use. Using, say, <span
class="math inline"><em>a</em> = 3</span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>b</em> = 8</span> we get: <span
class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}
		slope &amp;= \frac{\Delta output}{\Delta input} = \frac{\Delta
g(t)}{\Delta t}=\frac{g(b)-g(a)}{b-a}\\
		&amp;\\
		&amp;=\frac{g(8)-g(3)}{8-3}=\frac{1-11}{8-3}\\
		&amp;\\
		&amp;=\frac{-10}{5}=-2
	
\end{aligned}$$</span> You can verify for yourself that choosing a
different pair would give the same result.</p>
</div>
<p>While the formula for slope is essentially the same as the formula
for average rate of change (AROC), it is important to distinguish
between slope and AROC:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Every function has average rates of change. Only linear functions
have slopes. The word “slope” should only be used if you know the
function is linear.</p></li>
<li><p>For linear functions, the average rate of change (AROC) and the
slope are the same thing. But for a non-linear function, this AROC is
not a slope. Again, the word “slope” should only be used with linear
functions.</p></li>
<li><p>If a function is linear, it doesn’t matter which input-output
pairs you use. The formula will always give the same value for the
slope. But for non-linear functions, you may get different average rates
of change depending on which input-output pairs you use.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="linear-functions-and-mathematical-models">Linear Functions and
Mathematical Models</h3>
<p>One of our main reasons for studying linear functions is that there
are many real-world situations that can be modeled using them. Two of
many possible examples are the following:</p>
<div id="LinearFunctionsandSlopeExample3" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 5.3</strong>. A contractor who refinishes hardwood
floors calculates the prices, <span
class="math inline"><em>p</em></span>, he quotes for jobs as a linear
function of the area, <span class="math inline"><em>A</em></span>, in
square feet to be refinished; call this function <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em>(<em>A</em>)</span>. For a job measuring
<span class="math inline"><em>A</em> = 250</span> square feet he charges
<span class="math inline"><em>h</em>(250) = 500</span> dollars. For a
job measuring <span class="math inline"><em>A</em> = 600</span> square
feet he charges <span class="math inline"><em>h</em>(600) = 1025</span>
dollars. What is the slope of this pricing function <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em>(<em>A</em>)</span>? What is the rate at
which he changes prices based on area?</p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span> The function is linear so we can
calculate its slope:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$slope = \frac{\Delta output}{\Delta
input} =\frac{h(600)-h(250)}{600-2500} = \frac{1025-500}{600-250} =
\frac{525}{350}=1.5\\
$$</span></p>
<p>So, the slope is <span class="math inline">1.5</span>.<br />
</p>
<p>The rate of change here is the slope. The units of a rate of change
are always “output units per input unit”, and so since the output units
are dollars and the input units are square feet, the rate of change is
<span class="math inline">$1.50</span> per square foot. In other words,
for each additional square foot of area, he raises the price of the job
by <span class="math inline">$1.50</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="LinearFunctionsandSlopeExample4" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 5.4</strong>. The scientist Galileo Galilei
(1564-1642) discovered the principle of “uniform acceleration” – that
the speed at which a dropped object travels is a linear function of the
time since it was dropped. Suppose that at time <span
class="math inline"><em>t</em> = 0</span> the speed of a dropped rock is
<span class="math inline"><em>v</em>(0) = 0</span> feet per second, and
after <span class="math inline">2.5</span> seconds its speed is <span
class="math inline"><em>v</em>(2.5) = 80</span> feet per second. What is
the slope of the function <span
class="math inline"><em>v</em>(<em>t</em>)</span>? What is the rate of
change of the rock’s velocity?</p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>Since we know the function is linear
we can calculate its slope:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$slope = \frac{\Delta output}{\Delta
input} =\frac{v(2.5)-v(0)}{2.5-0} = \frac{80-0}{2.5-0}=32\\	$$</span></p>
<p>So the slope of this function is 32.<br />
</p>
<p>The rate of change of velocity is the slope of the velocity function,
but to answer the question asked we should include units in the answer.
Remember that the units of an average rate of change (and therefore the
units of a slope) are always “output units per input unit”, so the rate
of change of the rock’s velocity would be 32 feet per second per
second.</p>
</div>
<p>Now, in all of the examples we’ve considered so far, we’ve known the
function was linear because the problem specifically said it was linear.
But could we have known that without specifically being told? Surely the
contractor knows that he’s pricing jobs using a rate of <span
class="math inline">$1.50</span> per square foot, but it’s not at all
certain that he knows that he’s using the slope of a linear function.
And we know for certain that Galileo wasn’t thinking about linear
functions when he was studying the speed at which objects fall – because
the concept of a “linear function” did not exist until long after his
death! How did anyone ever determine that these functions were
linear?<br />
The key to knowing whether or not a given situation can be
mathematically modeled with a linear function is to ask “does this
function have a constant rate of change.” So, we need to think about the
average rate of change and what it means in terms of the situation
given, and then ask whether or not that average rate of change would
always be the same.<br />
So, in the case of the contractor, price is a function of the area to be
refinished. So price is the output, and area is the input, and so the
average rate of change would be how much price changes as the area to be
refinished changes, and it would be measured in dollars per square foot.
Does the contractor change his price per square foot (perhaps giving
discounts for larger jobs), or does he increase his overall job price
based on the area based on the same per-square-foot cost? If - and only
if - the overall job cost changes at the same rate based on the area,
then it is a linear function.<br />
Likewise, if - and only if - the speed of the falling rock is always
changing at the same rate, then speed is a linear function of time.
Galileo’s observation of “uniform acceleration” means that, yes, the
speed always changes at the same rate, and so the function is indeed
linear. <a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a><br />
A few examples will illustrate how this works.</p>
<div id="LinearFunctionsandSlopeExample5" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 5.5</strong>. An auto insurance company determines
its rates for a policy based on the number of points you have on your
license. They start with a base rate of <span
class="math inline">$600</span> which you would pay regardless of how
many points you have, and then they add a fixed dollar surcharge of
<span class="math inline">$80</span> for each point. Your insurance rate
is a function of how many points you have. Is it a linear function?</p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>Your insurance rate changes as the
number of points you have on your license changes, and following the
“output units per input unit” model this rate of change would be
measured in dollars per point. From the description it is clear that
this rate of change is a constant <span class="math inline">$80</span>
per point, and so the function is indeed linear. In fact, we know that
<span class="math inline">$80</span> per point is its slope.</p>

over <span class="math inline">100</span> pounds costs <span

But, once you reach <span class="math inline">100</span> pounds, the

linear.</p>

see the number of books checked out changing at the same rate of books

linear.</p>

<p>In the exercises you’ll have the opportunity to work through some
more examples, and we will see even more about this as we continue
through the rest of the chapter. At first you will probably need to
think things through slowly and carefully, but with practice you will
find it becomes much easier to identify whether or not a linear function
suits a given modeling situation.</p>
<h3 id="graphs-of-linear-functions">Graphs of Linear Functions</h3>
<p>The name “linear” suggests something to do with lines, and the word
“slope” suggests something to do with steepness. This is not a
coincidence. In fact, these names are suggestive of what we can expect
from the graphs of functions whose rates of change are constant.<br />
Let’s consider a simple example of a linear function. Suppose water is
flowing into a tub at a steady rate of 2 gallons per minute. Then the
amount of water in the tub is a function of time since the faucet was
turned on, and it is a linear function since its rate of change is a
constant 2 gallons per minute, as long as we only include in our
function’s domain the time that water is actually flowing (i.e. we don’t
consider the time before the faucet is turned on or after the tub is
full). Suppose we call this function <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>t</em>)</span>. We can create a table
that shows how much water is in the tub at certain times:</p>
<div class="center">
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align: center;"><span
class="math inline"><em>t</em></span> (minutes)</th>
<th style="text-align: center;"><span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>t</em>)</span> (gallons)</th>

<p>Now, if we plot the points in the coordinate plane, we see that they
fall in a straight line (we’ve chosen the window to show the portion of
the coordinate plane where all of our points fall):</p>
<figure>
<img src="Sections/LinearFunctionsandSlopeImages/Figure01.png" />
<figcaption>A plot of the values in the table</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Is this a coincidence? Does it just look like a straight line for the
particular points we happened to pick? Might the graph actually swerve
upward or downward or flatten out if we look at the whole picture
instead of just a few points?<br />
This is not a coincidence at all, and actually the fact that the rate of
change is constant makes it absolutely necessary that the function’s
graph be a straight line. Remember that:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$slope = \frac{\Delta output}{\Delta
input}$$</span></p>
<p>Now, since the vertical axis is the output axis, changes in output
show up in the graph as vertical changes, or in other words, up or down
movement of the graph. We call the up-down movement in the graph its
<strong>rise</strong>. By the same token, the horizontal axis is the
input axis, and changes in input show up as horizontal changes, or right
or left movement of the graph. We call this right or left movement
<strong>run</strong>. So, putting this together with the definition of
slope, we get:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$slope = \frac{\Delta output}{\Delta
input}=\frac{vertical \text{ } change}{horizontal \text{ } change} =
\frac{rise}{run}$$</span></p>
<p>Suppose we zoom in and look at our filling-tub function’s graph
between, say, <span class="math inline"><em>t</em> = 1</span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>t</em> = 2</span>. Between these points the
input changes by <span class="math inline">2 − 1 = 1</span> minute. And
the output changes by <span class="math inline">4 − 2 = 2</span>
gallons. We can see this in the graph as a rise of 2 and a run of 1:</p>
<figure>
<img src="Sections/LinearFunctionsandSlopeImages/Figure02.png" />
<figcaption>Visualizing slope graphically</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We can see the same thing if we look, say, between <span
class="math inline"><em>t</em> = 0</span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>t</em> = 3</span>. The run is 3 minutes, and the
rise is 6 gallons, keeping the slope where it should be at 6 = 2 gallons
per minute.<br />
The slope shows up in the graph as steepness. The slope is a constant 2,
and so the graph rises with a constant steepness of rising 2 units per 1
unit of run. Since the slope never changes, the steepness never changes,
and so we cannot possibly end up with anything other than a straight
line graph for the function overall:</p>
<figure>
<img src="Sections/LinearFunctionsandSlopeImages/Figure03.png" />
<figcaption>Graph of water in tub vs. time</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In summary: Slope shows up in a graph as steepness. Because slope is
constant, a linear function’s graph must have constant steepness, And
so, a function is linear if and only if its graph is a straight
line.</p>
<div id="LinearFunctionsandSlopeExample9" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 5.9</strong>. The height of a sunflower is a function
of time since the seed was planted. This function is sketched in the
graph below.</p>
<figure>
<img src="Sections/LinearFunctionsandSlopeImages/Figure04.png" />
<figcaption>Graph of water in tub vs. time</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Could this be a linear function? How do you know?</p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>If the function were linear, its
graph would be a straight line. This graph is not. The steepness of the
graph changes, reflecting the fact that the plant grows more rapidly at
certain times of its life cycle than at others. Because the steepness
and the rate of growth that it represents are not constant, the function
cannot possibly be linear.</p>
</div>
<p>The steepness of a graph indicates its rate of change. If a function
has a very large rate of change, the graph will be very steep. If a
function has a slow rate of change, the graph will be flatter.<br />
If the function is increasing, the slope will be positive and the graph
will slope upward. If the function is decreasing, the slope will be
negative, and the graph will slope downward.</p>
<div id="LinearFunctionsandSlopeExample10" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 5.10</strong>. Four graphs are shown in the window
below. Each graph belongs to a function which gives the amount of water
in a family pool (in gallons) as a function of time (in minutes). All
four pools start out with 500 gallons of water.<br />
The Ahmed’s are filling their pool at a steady rate of 20 gallons per
hour.<br />
The Billigsley’s are draining their pool at a steady rate of 20 gallons
per hour.<br />
The Chao’s are filling their pool at a steady rate of 50 gallons per
hour.<br />
The Damiani’s aren’t doing anything.<br />
Which graph goes with which family’s pool?</p>
<figure>
<img src="Sections/LinearFunctionsandSlopeImages/Figure05.png" />
</figure>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>The Billingsley’s are draining their
pool, so the amount of water in their pool is decreasing as a function
of time. So theirs must be the downward sloping line.<br />
The Ahmed’s and the Chao’s are both filling their pools, so they must
own the rising lines. Since the Chao’s are filling their pool faster,
their slope is larger, and so their graph must be the steeper one.<br />
Since the Damiani’s aren’t doing anything, their slope is zero and their
graph must be the flat one.</p>
</div>
<p>We have seen that we can find the slope of a given function based on
knowing any two of its input-output pairs. Input-output pairs are the
points on the graph of the function. And so, if we know any two points
on a linear function’s graph, we can calculate the function’s slope.</p>
<div id="LinearFunctionsandSlopeExample11" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 5.11</strong>. Find the slope of the linear function
whose graph passes through the points <span
class="math inline">(3, 5)</span> and <span
class="math inline">(−4, 13)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>We have two input values to use.
Suppose we take them in the order given and say <span
class="math inline"><em>a</em> = 3</span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>b</em> = −4</span>. (It doesn’t matter which you
call <span class="math inline"><em>a</em></span> and which you call
<span class="math inline"><em>b</em></span>; everything works out fine
whichever you choose.) Following the formula we get: <span
class="math display">$$slope=\frac{\Delta output}{\Delta input} =
\frac{\Delta f(x)}{\Delta x} =
\frac{f(-4)-f(3)}{-4-3}=\frac{13-5}{-4-3}=\frac{8}{-7}$$</span> So the
slope is <span class="math inline">$-\frac{8}{7}$</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>Sometimes the slope formula is written differently, based on the idea
of using two points on the graph to determine slope. If we have two
points, which we call <span
class="math inline">(<em>x</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>y</em><sub>1</sub>)</span>
and <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em><sub>2</sub>, <em>y</em><sub>2</sub>)</span>
we can use the formula:</p>
<p><span
class="math display">$$slope=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$$</span></p>
<p>It’s likely that you’ve seen the slope formula written in this way at
some point in the past. While this formula is correct and it works just
fine, it really isn’t necessary. It’s really just another way of writing
the slope formula that we’ve been using.<br />
In this text, we’ll continue to use the function-notation formula for
slope we’ve been using. There really is no advantage to this other
two-point formula, and the function-notation formula we’ve been using is
both more general and also will prove more useful to you in your future
mathematical career. So, while it is not incorrect to use this other
formula if you are used to using it, it is probably going to be to your
advantage to try to stick with the function-notation formula we’ve been
using.</p>

<h2 id="LinearFunctionsandIntercepts">Linear Functions and Their
Intercepts</h2>
<p>Let’s start this section by considering a linear function similar to
some others we’ve looked at already.<br />
Suppose you have a pool that you are filling by pumping water into it.
The pool starts out completely dry, and once the pump is switched on the
water flows into the pool at a constant rate of 20 gallons per
minute.<br />
The amount of water in the pool is a function of the time since the pump
is switched on. Furthermore, since the water is pumped in at a constant
rate, the water in the pool is a linear function of the time since the
pump is switched on. The slope of this linear function would be 20
gallons per minute.<br />
Now, based on this, can we come up with a formula for this linear
function? Well, if one minute has passed, it stands to reason that the
water in the pool would be:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$\frac{20 \text{ }gallons}{1 \text{ }
minute}*1\text{ }minute = 20\text{ }gallons$$</span></p>
<p>If three minutes have passed, it likewise stands to reason that the
water in the pool would be:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$\frac{20 \text{ }gallons}{1 \text{ }
minute}*3\text{ }minute = 60\text{ }gallons$$</span></p>
<p>And it should be clear that if 15 minutes pass, the water in the pool
would amount to:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$\frac{20 \text{ }gallons}{1 \text{ }
minute}*15\text{ }minute = 300\text{ }gallons$$</span></p>
<p>The pattern is clear. To determine the amount of water in the pool at
any time, we multiply the pumping rate by the number of minutes the pump
has been running. Or, in other words, after <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> minutes the pool will contain
<span class="math inline">20<em>x</em></span> gallons of water. So, the
formula for the amount of water in the pool as a function of time the
pump has run is given by the formula</p>
<p><span
class="math display"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = 20<em>x</em></span></p>
<div id="LinearFunctionsandInterceptsExample1" class="example">

Find a formula for the price for a load of firewood as a function of the
number of face cords.</p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>Since the price changes at a constant
rate, this is a linear function with slope <span
class="math inline">$75</span> per face cord. Applying the same logic we
used in the water pumping discussion above, it stands to reason that the
cost of a load of firewood will be calculated by multiplying this slope
by the number of face cords, so the function’s formula will be <span
class="math display"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = 75<em>x</em></span> where
<span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> is the number of face cords
and <span class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>)</span> is the
price.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="the-vertical-intercept">The Vertical Intercept</h3>
<p>Now, let’s return to our water pumping discussion. We assumed in that
discussion that the pool was empty when the pump was switched on. Now,
let’s consider a slightly different scenario.<br />
Suppose that a pool already has 800 gallons of water in it, and then a
pump is switched on which pumps water into the pool at a constant rate
of 20 gallons per minute. This obviously differs from our original
discussion because of the water that was in the pool at the start.<br />
Now, the water in the pool is still a function of time since the pump is
switched on (there is only one amount of water in the pool at any given
moment), and it also is still a linear function (since the amount of
water in the pool is changing at a constant rate) with slope 20 gallons
per minute. But the reasoning we used before does not quite work.<br />
After one minute, the pump will still have added (20 gallons/minute)(1
minute) = 20 gallons of water to the pool, but that is not the total
amount the pool contains. These 20 pumped-in gallons are in addition to
the original 800 gallons. So, the amount of water in the pool would
be:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}
	\frac{20 \text{ }gallons}{1 \text{ } minute}*1\text{ }minute + 800
\text{ }gallons &amp;= 20\text{ }gallons + 800\text{ }gallons \\
	&amp;=820\text{ }gallons
\end{aligned}$$</span></p>
<p>Similarly, after 3 minutes the pool would contain:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}
	\frac{20 \text{ }gallons}{1 \text{ } minute}*3\text{ }minute + 800
\text{ }gallons &amp;= 60\text{ }gallons + 800\text{ }gallons \\
	&amp;=860\text{ }gallons
\end{aligned}$$</span></p>
<p>And it should be clear that after 15 minutes the pool has:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}
	\frac{20 \text{ }gallons}{1 \text{ } minute}*15\text{ }minute + 800
\text{ }gallons &amp;= 300\text{ }gallons + 800\text{ }gallons \\
	&amp;=1100\text{ }gallons
\end{aligned}$$</span></p>
<p>So, the impact of the original 800 gallons is that we need to add it
to whatever we would have gotten just from looking at the water pumped
in. Following this, it seems that we can now arrive at a formula. After
<span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> minutes, the pool will
contain <span class="math inline">20<em>x</em></span> pumped in gallons
plus the original <span class="math inline">800</span> gallons, and so
the function can be given by the formula:</p>
<p><span
class="math display"><em>g</em>(<em>x</em>) = 20<em>x</em> + 800</span></p>
<div id="LinearFunctionsandInterceptsExample2" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 5.13</strong>. A landscaper sells firewood delivered
to your home for <span class="math inline">$75</span> per face cord plus
a <span class="math inline">$60</span> delivery charge. Find a formula
for the price for a load of firewood as a function of the number of face
cords.</p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>Following the reasoning we used in
the pool-filling example above we can see that the price would be
calculated by multiplying the slope of <span
class="math inline">$75</span> per face cord by the number of face
cords, and then adding the <span class="math inline">$60</span> delivery
charge. So a formula for this function would be: <span
class="math display"><em>g</em>(<em>x</em>) = 75<em>x</em> + 60</span>
where <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> is the number of face
cords and <span class="math inline"><em>g</em>(<em>x</em>)</span> is the
total cost of the order.</p>
</div>
<p>From these examples we can see that, in addition to their constant
rates of change, linear functions may also include a “starting point”
from which all that changing begins. This “starting point” for a linear
function is called its <strong>vertical intercept</strong>.<br />
We can see why it is called the vertical intercept by taking a look at
the graph of one of these linear functions. Let’s return to the second
pool-filling function, <span
class="math inline"><em>g</em>(<em>x</em>) = 20<em>x</em> + 800</span>.
In the previous section we discussed how to interpret a linear
function’s slope in its graph, as the line’s steepness or its “rise over
run”. Now let’s consider the vertical intercept of <span
class="math inline">800</span>.<br />
Recall that the 800 got involved in this formula because in the scenario
we were considering the pool started out with 800 gallons of water. So
800 gallons is indeed the “starting point”. Now, how long had the pump
been running when the pool contained this 800 gallons? Well, it hadn’t
been running at all – this was the pool volume right before the pump was
switched on. So, this output value of 800 gallons goes along with the
input value of 0 minutes. In other words, <span
class="math inline"><em>g</em>(0) = 800</span>. Which means that the
point <span class="math inline">(0, 800)</span> lies on this function’s
graph.<br />
Let’s locate that point in the plane. To plot <span
class="math inline">(0, 800)</span> we would not move at all to the left
of right of the origin, since the input coordinate value is 0. And then
we would move up 800 units to reach the output coordinate value of 800.
So our point would be located right here (using the window setting <span
class="math inline">−1 ≤ <em>x</em> ≤ 5</span> and <span
class="math inline">0 ≤ <em>g</em>(<em>x</em>) ≤ 1000</span>:</p>
<figure>
<img src="Sections/LinearFunctionsandInterceptsImages/Figure01.png" />
<figcaption>Graph showing <span
class="math inline">(0, 800)</span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Notice that this point lies on the output axis (which you should
recall is the vertical axis). And that is where the name comes from. If
we look at the function’s graph in this window:</p>
<figure>
<img src="Sections/LinearFunctionsandInterceptsImages/Figure02.png" />
<figcaption>Graph of <span
class="math inline"><em>g</em>(<em>x</em>) = 20<em>x</em> + 800</span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>we can see that this point can be thought of as the place where the
graph intersects the vertical axis (i.e. the output axis). And so we
call it the vertical intercept.</p>
<div id="LinearFunctionsandInterceptsExample3" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 5.14</strong>. A landscaper sells firewood delivered
to your home. The price is based on the number of face cords ordered.
The formula for the price is given by the function <span
class="math inline"><em>g</em>(<em>x</em>) = 75<em>x</em> + 60</span>.
What is the vertical intercept of this function?</p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>The vertical intercept is the
“starting point” for the function, and we know from looking at this
example before that the price starts at <span
class="math inline">$60</span> for delivery and then we add on the cost
for the amount of firewood ordered. Using that logic, we know that the
vertical intercept is 60.<br />
We could also see this from the function itself. We know the vertical
intercept is the value you get when your graph hits the vertical
(output) axis, which happens when the input value is <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em> = 0</span>. So, plugging in we would get:
<span class="math display"><em>g</em>(0) = 75(0) + 60 = 60</span> which
means that the point <span class="math inline">(0, 60)</span> is on the
graph, and that the vertical intercept is therefore 60.</p>
</div>
<p>The term “vertical intercept” is used a little inconsistently.
Sometimes when we say “vertical intercept” we mean the output value of
the function itself, and so in Example <a
href="#LinearFunctionsandInterceptsExample3" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="LinearFunctionsandInterceptsExample3">5.14</a> we would
say that the vertical intercept is 60. Sometimes, though, when we say
“vertical intercept” we actually mean the point itself where the graph
intersects the vertical (output) axis, and so we would say in that case
that the vertical intercept is <span class="math inline">(0, 60)</span>.
Either usage is correct, and it is almost always clear what is meant
whichever way you use the term. For Example <a
href="#LinearFunctionsandInterceptsExample3" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="LinearFunctionsandInterceptsExample3">5.14</a>, we would
have considered either “<span class="math inline">60</span>” or “<span

</div>
<p>It is often very helpful to think of the vertical intercept as the
“starting point”, but sometimes this interpretation is not completely
clear, as the following example shows. If a “starting point”
interpretation does not make sense, remember where it comes from. The
vertical intercept is the output value of the function when the input is
zero. This will be useful in the following example.</p>
<div id="LinearFunctionsandInterceptsExample6" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 5.17</strong>. The temperature in degrees Fahrenheit
is a linear function of the temperature in degrees Celsius, and is given
by the formula <span class="math inline">$f(C)=\frac{9}{5}C+32$</span>.
What is the vertical intercept of this function, and what does it mean
in terms of Fahrenheit and Celsius temperatures?</p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span> The vertical intercept is clearly
<span class="math inline">32</span>, but it’s not immediately clear what
a “starting point” of <span class="math inline">32</span> would mean.
Remember, though, that this is the output (in degrees Fahrenheit) that
you get when the input (in degrees Celsius) is <span
class="math inline">0</span>. So, when the input temperature is <span
class="math inline">0<sup>∘</sup><em>C</em></span>, the output
temperature is <span
class="math inline">32<sup>∘</sup><em>F</em></span>. This doesn’t really
lend itself well to a “starting point” interpretation, but it does make
sense - the vertical intercept here is based on the freezing point of
water, which happens to be <span
class="math inline">0<sup>∘</sup><em>C</em></span>.</p>
</div>
<p>Because it is traditional (though as we’ve repeatedly seen certainly
not necessary) to call the input variable of a function <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> and the output variable <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em></span>, the vertical axis can often be
called the <span class="math inline"><em>y</em></span>-axis, and
likewise the vertical intercept is often called the <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em></span>-intercept. This is so ingrained
that this name is often used even if the output variable has a different
name! For example, if we were looking at the linear relationship given
by the formula:</p>
<p><span class="math display"><em>p</em> = 3<em>x</em> + 12</span></p>
<p>the natural way to look at this would be as defining <span
class="math inline"><em>p</em></span> as a linear function of <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>. The vertical intercept of this
function is 12. Since the output variable is <span
class="math inline"><em>p</em></span> the vertical (output) axis could
also be called the <span class="math inline"><em>p</em></span>-axis, and
it would be reasonable to also call 12 the <span
class="math inline"><em>p</em></span>-intercept. And in fact this is
correct usage. Calling it either the “vertical intercept” or the “<span
class="math inline"><em>p</em></span>-intercept” would be equally
correct, and we will feel free to use either term.<br />
It really is not correct to call 12 the “<span
class="math inline"><em>y</em></span>-intercept” - there is no “<span
class="math inline"><em>y</em></span>” in this relationship! But it
still would not be unusual to hear someone call it the “<span
class="math inline"><em>y</em></span>-intercept” anyway. We will avoid
using the term “<span class="math inline"><em>y</em></span>-intercept”
unless the output variable actually is named <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em></span>, and you should too! But you also
should not be confused, surprised, shocked, or too deeply offended if
you run into this mostly harmless misuse of terminology.</p>

</div>
<p>The pattern is not hard to see. The vertical intercept seems to
always show up in a fairly obvious place in the formula. This is not a
coincidence! Think of the logic we used to find the formulas for the
pool-filling and firewood-pricing examples. We saw that to figure out
the formula, the pattern we needed was:</p>
<p><span
class="math display"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = (<em>s</em><em>l</em><em>o</em><em>p</em><em>e</em>)<em>x</em> + <em>v</em><em>e</em><em>r</em><em>t</em><em>i</em><em>c</em><em>a</em><em>l</em>
<em>i</em><em>n</em><em>t</em><em>e</em><em>r</em><em>c</em><em>e</em><em>p</em><em>t</em></span></p>
<p>It is not hard to imagine that this would be the case for every
linear function, and in fact it is. This leads us to the following
conclusion:</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><strong><u>Slope-Intercept Form</u></strong><br />
A function is linear if and only if its formula can be written in the
form <span
class="math display"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = <em>m</em><em>x</em> + <em>b</em></span>
where <span class="math inline"><em>m</em></span> is the slope and <span
class="math inline"><em>b</em></span> is the vertical intercept.<br />
A formula written in this way is said to be in <strong>slope-intercept
form</strong>.</p>
</div>
<p>(Naturally the names of the function and variable can be different;
<span
class="math inline"><em>g</em>(<em>t</em>) = <em>m</em><em>t</em> + <em>b</em></span>
is also considered to be slope-intercept form.)<br />
It is traditional to use the letter <span
class="math inline"><em>m</em></span> for slope; so much so that usually
when you see <span class="math inline"><em>m</em></span> used anywhere
in math you can usually assume it is meant to be a slope. No one really
knows why we use <span class="math inline"><em>m</em></span> for slope.
At this point it’s just a matter of tradition!<br />
Using <span class="math inline"><em>b</em></span> for the vertical
intercept is also very common. No one really knows why we use the letter
<span class="math inline"><em>b</em></span> as opposed to some other
letter either, but since the vertical intercept is often interpreted as
a starting point you can think of it as standing for “base” or
“beginning”. (That’s not really where it comes from, but it’s a handy
thing to remember anyway.)</p>
<div id="LinearFunctionsandInterceptsExample7" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 5.18</strong>. the function <span
class="math inline"><em>h</em>(<em>x</em>) = 8<em>x</em> + 5</span>
linear? If so, what is its slope, and what is its vertical
intercept?</p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>The formula for this function is
recognizable as being in the <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = <em>m</em><em>x</em> + <em>b</em></span>
form, and so we know it is indeed a linear function. We can see that
<span class="math inline"><em>m</em></span> is 8 so the slope is 8, and
we can see that <span class="math inline"><em>b</em></span> is 5 and so
the vertical intercept is 5.</p>
</div>
<p>Combining this slope-intercept form with what we already know about
the interpretation of slope and vertical intercept can give us insights
into the interpretation of a function from its formula.</p>
<div id="LinearFunctionsandInterceptsExample8" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 5.19</strong>. An equipment company rents power
equipment by the day. The charge to rent a vibrating tamper for <span
class="math inline"><em>t</em></span> days is calculated by the function
<span
class="math inline"><em>p</em>(<em>t</em>) = 27.5<em>t</em> + 15</span>.
Is this function linear? If so, what are the slope and vertical
intercept? What do they mean in terms of this equipment rental?</p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>The formula for the function fits the
slope-intercept (<span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = <em>m</em><em>x</em> + <em>b</em></span>)
form, with the slope <span class="math inline"><em>m</em></span> being
<span class="math inline">27.5</span> and the vertical intercept <span
class="math inline"><em>b</em></span> being <span
class="math inline">15</span>. (The input variable here is <span
class="math inline"><em>t</em></span> instead of <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>, but the name of the variable
doesn’t matter.)<br />
The slope is the rate of change, with units in output units per input
unit. So, since the output is cost in dollars and the input is days, the
slope is <span class="math inline">$27.50</span> per day. The company
charges <span class="math inline">$27.50</span> per day to rent the
tamper.<br />
The vertical intercept is the base, or starting point, and since it is
added in as part of the formula to get the output, it must be in the
output units. So the vertical intercept is <span
class="math inline">$15</span>. The company starts with a basic charge
of <span class="math inline">$15</span> to rent the tamper, regardless
of how long it is kept out.</p>
</div>
<p>It is important to note that a function is linear if and only if it’s
output can be written in slope-intercept (<span
class="math inline"><em>m</em><em>x</em> + <em>b</em></span>) form. A
function that is not written in this form may still be linear, so long
as we can put it into this form by simplification.</p>
<div id="LinearFunctionsandInterceptsExample9" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 5.20</strong>. Is the function <span
class="math inline"><em>g</em>(<em>t</em>) = 5(<em>t</em> − 7) + 4<em>t</em> − 2(7<em>t</em> − 5)</span>
linear? If so, what is its slope and vertical intercept? If not, how do
you know it is not?</p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>The function is clearly not currently
in slope-intercept (<span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = <em>m</em><em>x</em> + <em>b</em></span>)
form. But, with some algebraic simplification, we see that it can be
rewritten: <span class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}
		g(t)&amp;=5(t-7)+4t-2(7t-5)\\
		&amp;=5t-35+4t-14t+10\\
		&amp;=-5t-25
	
\end{aligned}$$</span> Which is very close to slope-intercept form,
except that it is a minus sign (<span class="math inline">−</span>)
between the terms instead of a addition sign <span
class="math inline">+</span>. But we can rewrite this as <span
class="math inline"><em>g</em>(<em>t</em>) = −5<em>t</em> + (−25)</span>
which does fit the form with slope <span
class="math inline"><em>m</em> = −5</span> and vertical intercept <span
class="math inline"><em>b</em> = −25</span>. So the function is
linear.</p>
</div>
<p>NOTE: Most of the time, we don’t bother rewriting the subtraction as
addition of a negative as we did here. From this point forward, we will
just recognize that “<span class="math inline">−5<em>t</em> − 25</span>”
is in fact in slope intercept form with a negative vertical intercept
without actually bothering to rewrite it as “<span
class="math inline">−5<em>t</em> + (−25)</span>”.</p>
<div id="LinearFunctionsandInterceptsExample10" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 5.21</strong>. Is the function <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = 2<em>x</em>(4<em>x</em> − 5) + 3(<em>x</em> − 7)</span>
linear? If so, what is its slope and vertical intercept? If not, how do
you know it is not?</p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>It certainly is not in
slope-intercept form now, but perhaps with some simplification we can

		&amp;=8x^2-10x+3x-21\\
		&amp;=8x^2-7x-21
	
\end{aligned}$$</span></p>
<p>Here we have reached an impasse. The first term, <span
class="math inline">8<em>x</em><sup>2</sup></span> contains an exponent,
something not allowed in the slope-intercept form. If there were other
like terms to combine it with there might be some hope of getting rid of
this “squared” term, but there is none. We cannot simplify this any
further, and so we know it cannot be put into slope-intercept form.
Therefore this function is not linear.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="the-horizontal-intercept">The Horizontal Intercept</h3>
<p>Just as graphs of linear functions intersect the vertical axis,
almost every linear function’s graph will intersect the horizontal axis
as well. The point where this happens is (not surprisingly) called the
<strong>horizontal intercept</strong> . Just as the vertical intercept
may also be referred to using the name of the output variable, the
horizontal intercept may also be referred to using the name of the input
variable. And just as the vertical intercept is often incorrectly
referred to as the “<span
class="math inline"><em>y</em></span>-intercept” when the output
variable’s name is not <span class="math inline"><em>y</em></span>, the
horizontal intercept is often incorrectly referred to as the “<span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>-intercept” when the input
variable’s name is not <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>.<br />
The horizontal intercept gets less attention than its vertical cousin.
One reason is that, while the very useful slope-intercept form of a
linear function’s formula uses the vertical intercept, there is no
corresponding useful form using the horizontal intercept. The other
reason is that while the vertical intercept is often interpretable as a
“starting point” for the function, the horizontal intercept usually does
not lend itself to any natural interpretation.<br />
If we do have reason to want to know a linear function’s horizontal
intercept, though, it is not all that difficult to find. When we are on
the horizontal axis, while we may have moved to the right or left of the
origin, we have not moved either up or down. And so the output variable
has a value of zero.<br />
So, to find the horizontal intercept, we set the output value to zero
and determine the input value which makes that happen.<br />
The following example will illustrate.</p>
<div id="LinearFunctionsandInterceptsExample11" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 5.22</strong>. What is the horizontal intercept for
the linear function <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>t</em>) = 3<em>t</em> + 12</span>?</p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>Setting the output value <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em></span> equal to <span
class="math inline">0</span> we get:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$f(t)=3t+12\\
		0=3t+12$$</span></p>
<p>an equation we can now solve for <span
class="math inline"><em>t</em></span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}
		0&amp;=3t+12\\
		-3t&amp;=12\\
		t&amp;=-4
	
\end{aligned}$$</span></p>
<p>And so we conclude that the horizontal intercept is <span
class="math inline">−4</span>. Or, equally correctly, we could say that
the horizontal intercept is <span class="math inline">(−4, 0)</span>.
(Note that it is the output value, not the input value, that is <span
class="math inline">0</span>.)<br />
It would also be correct to call this the <span
class="math inline"><em>t</em></span>-intercept in this context, since
the horizontal (input) axis can be called the <span
class="math inline"><em>t</em></span>-axis since the input variable is
<span class="math inline"><em>t</em></span>.</p>
</div>
<p>As far as interpretation of the horizontal intercept is concerned,
the important thing is to remember that the horizontal intercept is the
input value that makes the output variable equal <span
class="math inline">0</span>. Whether or not this is of much interest
really depends on whether or not the output variable being equal to
<span class="math inline">0</span> is of much interest. The following
example will illustrate.</p>
<div id="LinearFunctionsandInterceptsExample12" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 5.23</strong>. Jaye’s electric bill is a function of
his electric usage (in kilowatt-hours). The formula used to determine
his bill is <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = 0.1<em>x</em> + 12.5</span>.
Find and interpret</p>
<ol>
<li><p>the slope,</p></li>
<li><p>the vertical intercept, and</p></li>
<li><p>the horizontal intercept of this linear function.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span></p>
<ol>
<li><p>The slope can be seen from the fact that the formula is in
slope-intercept form. Its units are, as always, output units per input
unit. So the slope is <span class="math inline">$0.10</span> per
kilowatt hour. The slope represents how much he pays for each additional
kilowatt hour of electricity used.</p></li>
<li><p>The vertical intercept can also be seen from the slope-intercept
form. It is <span class="math inline">$12.50</span>. This would be his
bill is his usage were 0 kilowatt hours. So this is a flat rate charged
regardless of usage, which he pays just to have electric service to his
house.</p></li>
<li><p>To find the horizontal intercept, we set the output value to
<span class="math inline">0</span> and solve:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}
			0&amp;=0.1x+12.5\\
			-0.1x&amp;=12.5\\
			x&amp;=-125
		
\end{aligned}$$</span></p>
<p>Since the input to this function is electricity usage measured in
kilowatt-hours, this horizontal intercept would be interpreted to be
<span class="math inline">−125</span> kilowatt hours. This would happen
if his bill were <span class="math inline">$0</span>. So, the horizontal
intercept is telling us that in order for Jaye to have a <span
class="math inline">$0</span> electric bill, he would have to use
negative 125 kilowatt-hours of electricity.<br />
For most people, this makes no sense at all. You cannot use negative
electricity! And probably the horizontal intercept is not of much
interest to Jaye. In this situation we would simply say that there is no
practical interpretation of the horizontal intercept in this
context.<br />
But, on the other hand, maybe not. If Jaye was mistakenly overbilled
last month, it actually might be possible for his electric use to show
up as a negative number - to reflect the prior month’s overbilling. Or,
if Jaye has solar panels on his roof which generate electricity, it is
possible that the panels could generate 125 kilowatt-hours more
electricity than he actually uses, resulting in a bill for negative
kilowatt-hours.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>This example illustrates the horizontal intercept often is not of
much interest, but sometimes might be. Jaye probably didn’t get
overbilled and probably doesn’t have solar panels that produce more
electricity than he uses. But, while unlikely, neither of these
situations is impossible or absurd. To decide whether or not the
horizontal intercept is of any interest, you really need to answer the
question “is it reasonable that the output variable could be zero”.
Answering this question will tell you all you need to know about
interpreting the horizontal intercept!</p>

Sid disagrees. Sid calculates that if they use 100 kilowatt-hours they

<h2 id="FormulaLinearFunctions">Finding Formulas for Linear
Functions</h2>
<p>Of course not every function is linear, but lots and lots of useful
functions are. We’ve already seen some of the properties of linear
functions, specifically how to find their slopes and intercepts, and
what those slopes and intercepts tell you.<br />
In almost all of our work so far, though, we’ve assumed that we already
had a formula for a given linear function, and then could work from that
formula. In this section, we’ll fully explore something we’ve hinted at
in a few examples but not yet developed: how to find the formula for a
function that we’ve determined to be linear. As you’ll see, the
properties of linear functions that we’ve already observed are not just
helpful in interpreting functions whose formulas we somehow already know
– they are incredibly useful in helping us find formulas for those
functions in the first place!</p>
<h3
id="formulas-for-linear-functions-given-slope-and-intercept">Formulas
for Linear Functions Given Slope and Intercept</h3>
<p>In Chapter <a href="#LinearFunctionsandIntercepts"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="LinearFunctionsandIntercepts">5.2</a>, we introduced the
slope-intercept form for a linear function, <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = <em>m</em><em>x</em> + <em>b</em></span>.
We noted that a function is linear if and only if it can be written in
this form. So, if we know the slope and vertical intercept of a linear
function, we can write a formula for the function simply by plugging
that slope and intercept into this general form.</p>
<div id="FormulaLinearFunctionsExample1" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 5.24</strong>. Suppose <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>)</span> is a linear function
whose slope is <span class="math inline">−5</span> and vertical
intercept is <span class="math inline">(0, 8)</span>. Find a formula for
<span class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>Since it is linear, we know that
<span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = <em>m</em><em>x</em> + <em>b</em></span>
for the appropriate values of <span
class="math inline"><em>m</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>b</em></span>. Now <span
class="math inline"><em>m</em></span> is the slope, so we know that
<span class="math inline"><em>m</em></span> is <span
class="math inline">−5</span>. The vertical intercept can be given as a
point, as it is here, or just as the output value of that point which
would be just <span class="math inline">8</span>, and so that’s <span
class="math inline"><em>b</em></span>. So substituting those values into
the slope-intercept form we get that <span
class="math display"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = −5<em>x</em> + 8</span></p>
</div>
<p>It really is just that simple, if we know the slope and vertical
intercept. Of course, we won’t always have those values at our disposal,
but since they are pretty significant features, it’s actually not all
that unusual to have them available to find a linear function’s formula.
In fact, when we worked out a couple formulas at the start of Section <a
href="#LinearFunctionsandIntercepts" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="LinearFunctionsandIntercepts">5.2</a> using common sense
reasoning, this is in fact what we were doing.</p>

</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>The function is linear, because with
each full daily dose the number of pills changes by the same amount, it

precisely, it is the number of pills in the bottle when the number of

class="math inline">−3</span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>b</em></span> is <span
class="math inline">75</span>. And so: <span
class="math display"><em>f</em>(<em>t</em>) = −3<em>t</em> + 75</span></p>
</div>
<p>It’s not unusual to change the formula a bit, especially when a
different order might seem to better reflect the “story” the function is
describing. Here, we start with <span class="math inline">75</span>
pills and then take away <span class="math inline">3</span> each day, so
it might seem more natural to write this as <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>t</em>) = 75 − 3<em>t</em></span>. Of
course, this is algebraically equivalent to the formula we wrote above,
so this alternative is also a correct formula for the function. At least
for now, we will try to stick with the <span
class="math inline"><em>m</em><em>x</em> + <em>b</em></span> order, to
emphasize that this is what we are using, but it is not at all incorrect
to write this function either way.</p>
<h3
id="formulas-for-linear-models-given-slope-and-input-output-pair">Formulas
for Linear Models Given Slope and Input-Output Pair</h3>
<p>Of course, we aren’t always lucky enough to have both the slope and
the vertical intercept. If we have the slope and one input-output pair
for a linear function, we can still find the function’s formula, albeit
with a little more effort required. We will present two different
methods for doing this by way of a specific example. Either method will
always work, and so which one you use is a matter of preference.<br />
</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><strong><u>Method #1: Back Substitution</u></strong><br />
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Start with the general form <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = <em>m</em><em>x</em> + <em>b</em></span>
(replacing the <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>)</span> with the actual names
of the function and input variable if they are different)</p></li>
<li><p>Plug in the known value of the slope as <span
class="math inline"><em>m</em></span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Using the known input-output pair, plug in the input for <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> and the output for <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Solve the resulting equation for <span
class="math inline"><em>b</em></span> to get the vertical
intercept.</p></li>
<li><p>You now have the slope and vertical intercept; use these in the
“<span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = <em>m</em><em>x</em> + <em>b</em></span>”
form to get the function formula.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>We can see how this works with the following two examples. We will
actually start with a “numbers only” example just to show how this
method works, and then will move to a real-world application example
which will allow us to see both how the method works and a little bit of
interpretation along the way.</p>
<div id="FormulaLinearFunctionsExample3" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 5.26</strong>. Find the formula for the linear
function <span class="math inline"><em>g</em>(<em>t</em>)</span> given
that the function’s slope is <span class="math inline">−4.5</span> and
the function’s graph passes through the point <span
class="math inline">(5, 12)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span></p>
<ol>
<li><p>We begin with the fact that since we know <span
class="math inline"><em>g</em>(<em>t</em>)</span> is linear, it must
have a formula of the form: <span
class="math display"><em>g</em>(<em>t</em>) = <em>m</em><em>x</em> + <em>b</em></span></p></li>
<li><p>Now since we know the slope, we can plug that in to get: <span
class="math display"><em>g</em>(<em>t</em>) = −4.5<em>t</em> + <em>b</em></span></p></li>
<li><p>Next, since the graph passes through the point <span
class="math inline">(5, 12)</span> we know that <span
class="math inline"><em>g</em>(5) = 12</span>, and so if we plug in the
input of <span class="math inline">5</span> for <span
class="math inline"><em>t</em></span> the output must be <span
class="math inline">12</span>. Plugging those values in we get: <span
class="math display">12 = −4.5(5) + <em>b</em></span></p></li>
<li><p>Now this is an equation we can solve for <span
class="math inline"><em>b</em></span>. Doing that we get: <span
class="math display">12 = −22.5 + <em>b</em></span> <span
class="math display"><em>b</em> = 34.5</span></p></li>
<li><p>So now we know that our function’s slope is <span
class="math inline">−4.5</span> and its vertical intercept is <span
class="math inline">34.5</span>. So, putting these facts together, we
conclude that the formula is: <span
class="math display"><em>g</em>(<em>t</em>) = −4.5<em>t</em> + 34.5</span></p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>In this first example we listed the numbered steps of the method
explicitly. We won’t do that in future examples, but you can see that we
are in fact still following them. In the next example, we’ll use the
method to find a formula where there is a real world interpretation to
the linear function and see how this gives some extra insight into why
this method works.</p>
<div id="FormulaLinearFunctionsExample4" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 5.27</strong>. An online music site charges a fixed
monthly membership fee, which allows unlimited streaming. Members can
also download songs for <span class="math inline">$0.85</span> each.
Last month I downloaded <span class="math inline">32</span> songs and
paid <span class="math inline">$35.20</span>. Find a formula for the
amount I pay as a function of the number of songs I download.</p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>First we note that this function
would indeed be linear. The input is music purchased (counted in songs),
and the output is cost (in dollars). The rate of change would be dollars
per song, and we are told this is a constant <span
class="math inline">$0.85</span> per song. So the function is
linear.<br />
If we let <span class="math inline"><em>s</em></span> be the number of
songs and <span class="math inline"><em>C</em>(<em>s</em>)</span> be the
cost for downloading that many songs, then: <span
class="math display"><em>C</em>(<em>s</em>) = <em>m</em><em>x</em> + <em>b</em></span>
Plugging in the known slope we get: <span
class="math display"><em>C</em>(<em>s</em>) = 0.85<em>s</em> + <em>b</em></span>
Since an input of <span class="math inline">32</span> songs gives and
output of a <span class="math inline">$35.20</span> charge, we know:
<span class="math display">35.2 = 0.85(32) + <em>b</em></span> And so we
solve for <span class="math inline"><em>b</em></span> and get: <span
class="math display">35.2 = 27.2 + <em>b</em></span> <span
class="math display"><em>b</em> = 8</span> Putting the slope and
vertical intercept together we get that the overall formula must be:
<span
class="math display"><em>C</em>(<em>s</em>) = 0.85<em>s</em> + 8</span>
We can add some interpretation to this formula as well. The vertical
intercept is the charge you’d pay when the input - the number of songs
you download - is zero. So, we can interpret this function as telling us
that you pay <span class="math inline">$8</span> per month just to have
the service, plus <span class="math inline">$0.85</span> per
download.</p>
</div>
<p>This example agrees with a less-structured but commonsense way of
figuring this out. Rather than using the formal method we’ve laid out
here, you could have figured this formula out by reasoning that since
each download costs <span class="math inline">$0.85</span>, I must have
paid <span class="math inline">32($0.85) = $27.20</span> for the
downloads. Since my total charge was <span
class="math inline">$35.20</span>, the membership fee must have been
<span class="math inline">$35.20 − $27.20 = $8</span>. From this you
could have easily arrived at the formula.<br />
Such reasoning is perfectly correct, and in fact if you look through the
example, it’s actually pretty much what we did! There’s nothing wrong
with taking this less-structured approach, but in cases where the
interpretation is not so easy to see it may not work so well. The
structured method we’ve laid out here always works, whether the
interpretation is easy, difficult, or even if there is no interpretation
at all (as in Example <a href="#FormulaLinearFunctionsExample3"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="FormulaLinearFunctionsExample3">5.26</a>).<br />
Now at the start of this section we promised a second method, and we
will introduce that now, and then illustrate its use with the same two
examples we’ve just worked out with the first method. Again, it must be
emphasized that both methods will always work, but for a number of
reasons, your instructor may prefer, or even insist that you use one or
the other. Make sure that you are clear about the expectations in the
course that you are taking.</p>
<h3 id="point-slope-form">Point-Slope Form</h3>
<p>This second method is a formula, derived from the formula for slope.
Before presenting the formula, we’ll briefly show where it comes from.
Though you need not fear being asked to reproduce the derivation
yourself, it’s good to see at least once that our formulas really do
come from somewhere!<br />
Our formula for slope can be written in the form:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$m=\frac{\Delta f(x)}{\Delta x} =
\frac{\Delta output}{\Delta input}$$</span></p>
<p>Now, suppose we have a particular input-output pair for a linear
function. If we call this particular input value <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em><sub>0</sub></span> then we would call the
output value <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em><sub>0</sub>)</span> or using
an output variable we could call it just <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em><sub>0</sub></span>. To keep the notation
a little simpler, we will use <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em><sub>0</sub></span> instead of the
function notation here.<br />
Now let’s let just plain <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> and
just plain <span class="math inline"><em>y</em></span> be any other
input and output for this function. (To be clear: <span
class="math inline">(<em>x</em><sub>0</sub>, <em>y</em><sub>0</sub>)</span>
is the specific input-output pair that we know, and just plain <span
class="math inline">(<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>)</span> represents any other
input-output pair for the function - not any specific input-output pair
that we know.)<br />
<span
class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>t</em><em>p</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></span>
and <span
class="math inline"><em>Δ</em><em>i</em><em>n</em><em>p</em><em>u</em><em>t</em></span>
can be found by subtracting outputs and inputs, and so going back to the
slope formula we’d get: <span
class="math display">$$m=\frac{y-y_0}{x-x_0}$$</span> Which we can then
solve for <span class="math inline"><em>y</em></span> by first clearing
the fraction and then simplifying:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}
	\frac{y-y_0}{x-x_0}&amp;=m\\
	\left( \frac{y-y_0}{x-x_0} \right)(x-x_0) &amp;= m(x-x_0)\\
	y-y_0&amp;=m(x-x_0)\\
	y&amp;=m(x-x_0)+y_0
\end{aligned}$$</span></p>
<p>This work has led us to the point-slope form for the equation of a
linear function. Plugging in the slope and known input-output pair
directly into this form gives an equation for the linear function; it
can then be readily simplified into slope-intercept form.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><strong><u>Method #2: Point-Slope Form</u></strong><br />
If <span class="math inline"><em>m</em></span> is the slope and <span
class="math inline">(<em>x</em><sub>0</sub>, <em>y</em><sub>0</sub>)</span>
is a given input-output pair for a linear function, the function’s
formula can be found by plugging these values into the form: <span
class="math display"><em>y</em> = <em>m</em>(<em>x</em> − <em>x</em><sub>0</sub>) + <em>y</em><sub>0</sub></span>
If the input variable is a letter other than <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> that letter would be used in place
of <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> in this form; if there is
an output variable given then that letter would likewise be used in
place of <span class="math inline"><em>y</em></span>.<br />
This can then be simplified into slope-intercept form if desired, and
the <span class="math inline"><em>y</em></span> can be replaced with an
<span class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>)</span> to use function
notation.</p>
</div>
<p>We will illustrate the use of this method by reworking the previous
two examples.</p>
<div id="FormulaLinearFunctionsExample5" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 5.28</strong>. Find the formula for the linear
function <span class="math inline"><em>g</em>(<em>t</em>)</span> given

</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>Here the input variable is <span

<span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>. There is no output variable

We have here that <span class="math inline"><em>m</em> = −4.5</span>,
<span class="math inline"><em>t</em><sub>0</sub> = 5</span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em><sub>0</sub> = 12</span>. We plug these
into the point-slope form to get:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$y=m(t-t_0)+y_0\\
		y=-4.5(t-5)+12$$</span></p>
<p>and now we simplify:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$y=-4.5t+22.5 + 12\\
		y=-4.5t+34.5$$</span></p>
<p>and finally rewriting in function form by replacing the <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em></span> with an <span
class="math inline"><em>g</em>(<em>t</em>)</span>: <span
class="math display"><em>g</em>(<em>t</em>) = −4.5<em>t</em> + 34.5</span></p>

known input output pair <span

<h3
id="formulas-for-linear-models-given-two-input-output-pairs">Formulas
for Linear Models Given Two Input-Output Pairs</h3>
<p>Sometimes we are not even lucky enough to have the slope for a linear
function. We can, however, still find the formula for a linear function
if we have not just one but two input-output pairs for the
function.<br />
Remember that if we know two input-output pairs for a function, we can
use them to calculate its slope. Then, once we have the slope, we can
use the methods we’ve already discussed in this chapter to find the
formula for the function. If we have the slope and one input-output pair
we are set - and in this case, we actually have more than one!</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><strong><u>Method for Finding the Formula for a

slope</p></li>
<li><p>Use the slope together with either one of the input-output pairs
to find the function’s formula, using methods previously
discussed.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>Essentially then we are just adding on an additional step at the
start - finding the slope. Once we’ve done that, we are pretty much in
the same boat as before.</p>
<div id="FormulaLinearFunctionsExample7" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 5.30</strong>. Find the formula for the linear
function whose graph passes through the points <span
class="math inline">(2, 9)</span> and <span
class="math inline">(−1, 24)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>We first find the slope: <span
class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}
		m&amp;=\frac{\Delta output}{\Delta input}=\frac{\Delta f(x)}{\Delta
x}=\frac{f(2)=f(-1)}{2-(-1)}\\
		\\
		&amp;=\frac{9-24}{2-(-1)}\\
		\\
		&amp;=\frac{-15}{3}\\
		\\
		&amp;=-5
	
\end{aligned}$$</span></p>
<p>We now know the slope and can use it together with either of the two
given input-output pairs. Here we will use <span
class="math inline">(2, 9)</span> for no particular reason other than we
have to pick one of them. (Using the other pair will work equally
well).<br />
We’ll use the Back Substitution Method here (though using the
point-slope form would work equally well. You’ve got choices!)<br />
Since the function is linear we know it can be written in the form:
<span
class="math display"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = <em>m</em><em>x</em> + <em>b</em></span>
Plugging in the slope we get: <span
class="math display"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = −5<em>x</em> + <em>b</em></span>
And now plugging in the input-output pair and solving for <span
class="math inline"><em>b</em></span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}
		9&amp;=-5(2)+b\\
		9&amp;=-10+b\\
		b=19
	
\end{aligned}$$</span></p>
<p>And finally putting this all together we get: <span
class="math display"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = −5<em>x</em> + 19</span></p>
</div>
<p>Knowing a second input-output pair gives an opportunity to check your
answer if you like. If the formula is correct, we know it should give
<span class="math inline"><em>f</em>(−1) = 24</span> because <span
class="math inline">(−1, 24)</span> is on its graph. You can verify for
yourself that this does indeed work correctly.</p>
<div id="FormulaLinearFunctionsExample8" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 5.31</strong>. In patients with diabetes, blood sugar
levels often fluctuate dramatically during the day and from day to day.
Therefore, measuring a patient’s blood sugar level at any given time
does not really reveal very much about overall blood sugar
control.<br />
A blood test known as “glycated hemoglobin” or “A1C” can be performed
which measures a patients overall average blood sugar levels over the
previous two to three months. It measures the percent of hemoglobin in
the blood that has been affected by exposure to glucose. The average
blood sugar level is a linear function of the A1C level. An A1C level of
<span class="math inline">7.0%</span> corresponds to an average blood
sugar of <span
class="math inline">154<em>m</em><em>g</em>/<em>d</em><em>l</em></span>
(milligrams of glucose per deciliter of blood). An A1C level of <span
class="math inline">10.0%</span> corresponds to an average blood sugar
level of <span

</ol>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Here we know two input-output pairs, and so we can use them to
find the slope: <span class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}
			m&amp;=\frac{\Delta output}{\Delta input}=\frac{\Delta average \text{ }

			\\
			&amp;=\frac{87}{3}\\
			\\
			&amp;=29
		
\end{aligned}$$</span></p>
<p>Now we can use either input-output pair together with this slope to
find the vertical intercept and complete the formula. Using <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>)</span> for the input variable
and function name we get: <span
class="math display"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = <em>m</em><em>x</em> + <em>b</em></span>
For no reason other than we’ve got to pick one, we’ll use the pair <span
class="math inline">(10, 241)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}
			241&amp;=29(10)+b\\
			241&amp;=290+b\\
			b&amp;=-49
		
\end{aligned}$$</span></p>
<p>Putting this together we get the formula: <span
class="math display"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = −29<em>x</em> − 49</span></p></li>
<li><p>Now that we have the formula we can use it. Plugging in <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em> = 8.2</span> we get:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}
			f(x)&amp;=29x-49\\
			f(8.2)&amp;=29(8.2)-49\\
			f(8.2)&amp;=188.8
		
\end{aligned}$$</span></p>
<p>So an A1C level of <span class="math inline">8.2%</span> indicates an
average blood sugar level of <span
class="math inline">188.8<em>m</em><em>g</em>/<em>d</em><em>l</em></span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Once again using the formula, but this time substituting in an
output value:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}
			f(x)&amp;=29x-49\\
			100&amp;=29x-49\\
			151&amp;=29x\\
			x=\frac{151}{29} \approx 5.21.
		
\end{aligned}$$</span></p>
<p>So an average blood sugar of <span

equates to an A1C level of approximately <span

<p>Linear functions by definition must have a constant rate of change.
What this means in a given application, though, can lead to some
confusion. For example, suppose that a small ice cream company is trying
to mathematically model its profits. The company has fixed costs (that
is, costs that they have to pay regardless of how much ice cream they
sell) of <span class="math inline">$4, 000</span> per month. They sell
their ice cream for <span class="math inline">$3.50</span> per pint, and
it costs them <span class="math inline">$2.25</span> to make each pint
of ice cream. Ben says: “Well, our profit is clearly a linear function
of the number of pints of ice cream we sell. Since <span
class="math inline">$3.50</span> - <span
class="math inline">$2.25</span> = <span
class="math inline">$1.25</span>, we make the same, steady <span
class="math inline">$1.25</span> per pint sold. Since our profits as a
function of pints sold increase at a constant rate, the function is
linear.”<br />
Jerry says: “Nonsense! I agree that if our profit per pint sold were
constant, the function would be linear, but it’s not! If we sell, say,
<span class="math inline">5000</span> pints, we take in <span
class="math inline">5000($3.50) = $17, 500</span>. It costs us <span
class="math inline">5000($2.25) = $11, 250</span> to make that ice
cream, plus our fixed costs are <span
class="math inline">$4, 000</span>, for a total of <span
class="math inline">$15, 250</span>. So we make <span
class="math inline">$17, 500 − $15, 250 = $2, 250</span> profit. And
that would be <span class="math inline">$2, 250/5000</span> pints =
<span class="math inline">$0.45</span> per pint. But now if we sell just
<span class="math inline">2000</span> pints, we take in <span
class="math inline">2000($3.50) = $7, 000</span>. That ice cream costs
<span class="math inline">2000($2.25) = $4, 500</span> to make, and so
when you add in our fixed costs our costs are <span

<h2 id="LinearFunctionsGraphs">Linear Functions and Their Graphs</h2>
<p>We have already discussed the graphs of linear functions in the
previous sections of this chapter.<br />
Some key points that we have noted:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The graphs of linear functions are straight lines</p></li>
<li><p>The slope can be interpreted as <span
class="math inline">$\frac{rise}{run}$</span> and determines the
steepness of the line</p></li>
<li><p>The vertical intercept is where the graph crosses the vertical
axis</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In this section we will discuss some other facts about linear
functions’ graphs, and the uses to which they can be put.</p>
<h3 id="graphical-solution-of-linear-equations">Graphical Solution of
Linear Equations</h3>
<p>When working with linear mathematical models, we often need to solve
equations that arise from linear functions. Not surprisingly, these
equations are called linear equations.<br />
It is often simplest to solve linear equations using regular
run-of-the-mill algebra. However, graphical solution is also an option.
In the following example we will illustrate the use of graphical
solution for linear equations. You may want to review Section <a
href="#SolvingEquationsGraphically" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="SolvingEquationsGraphically">4.3</a>, Solving Equations
Graphically for a refresher.</p>
<div id="LinearFunctionsGraphsExample1" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 5.32</strong>. Menauhant Publishing Company has a
contract that costs them a straight <span class="math inline">$80</span>
per hour for computer support over the phone. They are considering
switching to a new contract that would require them to pay an annual fee
of <span class="math inline">$3, 000</span> regardless of how much
service they use, but they would then only be charged <span
class="math inline">$50</span> per hour. If they don’t need many hours
of support, the old plan would be cheaper, since even though they’d pay
a higher rate per hour they’d avoid the <span
class="math inline">$3, 000</span> flat fee. On the other hand, if they
use a lot of hours, it would be worth it to pay that fee to get the
lower rate. How many hours of support would they need to use to break
even between the two plans?</p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span> Under the current plan, the total
cost is a linear function of hours: <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = 80<em>x</em></span>.<br />
Under the new plan, the total cost would also be a linear function of
hours: <span
class="math inline"><em>g</em>(<em>x</em>) = 50<em>x</em> + 3000</span>.<br />
We are looking for the number of hours where the costs would be the
same, so we need to solve the equation: <span
class="math display">80<em>x</em> = 50<em>x</em> + 3000</span> To solve
this equation graphically, we set “Y1=80X” and “Y2=50X+3000” and graph
the results. With a little playing around to find an appropriate window,
we get a graph that looks like this:</p>
<figure>
<img src="sections/LinearFunctionsGraphsImages/Figure01.png" />
<figcaption>Graph of <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = 80<em>x</em></span> and
<span
class="math inline"><em>g</em>(<em>x</em>) = 50<em>x</em> + 3000</span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Running through the calculator Intersect program, we end up with the
intersection X=<span class="math inline">100</span> and Y=<span
class="math inline">8000</span>. So, the break even point is <span
class="math inline">100</span> hours of computer support.</p>
</div>
<p>In this first example, it probably would have been easier to just
solve the equation with ordinary algebra. However, as we saw in Section
<a href="#SolvingEquationsGraphically" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="SolvingEquationsGraphically">4.3</a>, with more complex
equations graphical solution starts to become a more attractive option.
Which solution method you use in any given situation is to some degree
at least a matter of personal preference - and it is always good to have
a choice.</p>
<div id="LinearFunctionsGraphsExample2" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 5.33</strong>. Solve: <span
class="math display">1.43<em>x</em> − 2.07(1.08<em>x</em> − 2.75) = 3.12 + 2.59(0.76<em>x</em> − 3.55)</span></p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>This is actually a linear equation;

</div>
<h3 id="graphical-solution-of-linear-inequalities">Graphical Solution of
Linear Inequalities</h3>
<p>Sometimes we need to exactly match a particular goal, but often we
really need to fall above or below a particular target. In those cases
it is not an equation we need to solve, but instead an inequality.<br />
Graphing can be a very effective method for solving inequalities. To
solve an inequality graphically, we follow the same process as we would
use to solve an equation graphically. However, with the inequality we
want one side to be either below or above the other. So, we find the
point where the two graphs cross (i.e. we find the intersection), and
then choose the side of that intersection where the graph of the side
which is supposed to be less is below the side which is supposed to be
more.<br />
Consider the following reworking of the first example of this
section:</p>
<div id="LinearFunctionsGraphsExample3" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 5.34</strong>. Menauhant Publishing Company has a
contract that costs them a straight <span class="math inline">$80</span>
per hour for computer support over the phone. They are considering
switching to a new contract that would require them to pay an annual fee
of <span class="math inline">$3, 000</span> regardless of how much
service they use, but they would then only be charged <span
class="math inline">$50</span> per hour. How many hours of support would
they need to use for the new plan to be cheaper?</p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>Here we are not trying to find the
break-even point (where the old plan and new plan cost the same), we
instead want the new plan to be cheaper. Since the new plan’s cost is
<span class="math inline">50<em>x</em> + 3000</span> and the old plan is
<span class="math inline">80<em>x</em></span>, we need to solve: <span
class="math display">50<em>x</em> + 3000 = 80<em>x</em></span> Here we
will solve it graphically. Letting Y1 be the left side and Y2 be the
right side, we get the graph:</p>
<figure>
<img src="sections/LinearFunctionsGraphsImages/Figure03.png" />
<figcaption>Graph of <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = 80<em>x</em></span> and
<span
class="math inline"><em>g</em>(<em>X</em>) = 50<em>x</em> + 3000</span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The two lines intersect at <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em> = 100</span> but this time we are
interested in what happens before and after that intersection as well.
We know that Y1, old new plan, has a smaller slope than Y2, the new
plan, so Y1 is the less-steep line. Now, since we want Y1 the new plan
to be less than Y2, the old plan, we want the less-steep line to be
below the more-steep one. We can see from the graph that this happens to
the right of the intersection – so our inequality is satisfied whenever
<span class="math inline"><em>x</em> &gt; 100</span>. (We do not include
the intersection itself in our solution since the problem stated that we
wanted the new plan to be strictly cheaper than the old plan, and at
<span class="math inline">100</span> hours the two plans are equal.) So
we conclude that this is our solution: the new plan will be cheaper if
the company uses more than <span class="math inline">100</span> hours of
computer support.</p>
</div>
<p>In this example we could readily tell which graph represented which
side simply by looking at the steepness and slope. When finding the
slope would require some algebraic effort, though, there is another
approach.</p>
<div id="LinearFunctionsGraphsExample4" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 5.35</strong>. Solve: <span
class="math display">1.43<em>x</em> − 2.07(1.08<em>x</em> − 2.75) ≥ 3.12 + 2.59(0.76<em>x</em> − 3.55)</span></p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>This inequality has the same two
sides as the equation we solved in Example <a
href="#LinearFunctionsGraphsExample2" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="LinearFunctionsGraphsExample2">5.33</a>, so the graph
will be the same. Because neither side was in slope-intercept form,
though, the slopes are not obvious, so we can’t use the slopes to
determine which line belongs to which side. We could work them out by
putting each side into slope-intercept form, but it is not really
necessary for us to do this. If we hit the TRACE key on the calculator,
the calculator will place the blinking TRACE icon on one of the graphs
(usually Y1) and indicate which graph you are on at the top of the
screen. The result should look like this:</p>
<figure>
<img src="sections/LinearFunctionsGraphsImages/Figure04.png" />
<figcaption>Graph showing TRACE</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>So now we can easily tell which side is Y1. Since we wanted Y1, the
left side of the inequality, to be greater than or equal to Y2, the
right, the solution to our inequality is the intersection and everything
to the right of it, since Y1 is above Y2 to the right of the
intersection. So the solution would be <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em> ≤ 4.24</span>, or <span
class="math inline">{<em>x</em>|<em>x</em> ≤ 4.24}</span> or <span
class="math inline">(−∞, 4.24]</span>. Note that since the original
inequality was <span class="math inline">≥</span> we include the
intersection in our solution.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="parallel-and-perpendicular-lines">Parallel and Perpendicular
Lines</h3>
<p>We’ve already seen that sometimes equations don’t have any solutions.
For example, if we try to solve: <span
class="math display">3<em>x</em> + 7 = 3(<em>x</em> + 1)</span> we
distribute on the right:</p>
<p><span
class="math display">3<em>x</em> + 7 = 3<em>x</em> + 3</span></p>
<p>and then subtract <span class="math inline">3<em>x</em></span> from
both sides to get the obvious contradiction: <span
class="math display">7 = 3</span> and so we conclude that this equation
has no solutions.<br />
Now, notice here that this is a linear equation; both sides of this
equation can be regarded as linear functions. Looking at them that way,
there is another way to see why this equation has no solutions. Both
sides of this equation are lines with slope of 3. So they both have the
same steepness. The one on the left crosses the vertical axis at 7, the
other crosses the axis at 3 - so they are apart there, and since they
rise with exactly the same steepness, they stay apart.<br />
In other words, these lines are parallel. And following the logic above,
we can see that two lines will be parallel whenever they have the same
slopes. This is worth noting in general:</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><u>Slopes of Parallel Lines</u><br />
Two lines are parallel if, and only if, they have the same slopes.</p>
</div>
<p>We can use this fact to solve problems like the following.</p>
<div id="LinearFunctionsGraphsExample5" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 5.36</strong>. Find the formula for the linear
function whose graph passes through the point <span
class="math inline">(−2, 5)</span> and is parallel to the graph of <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = 2<em>x</em> − 3</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>The slope of <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = 2<em>x</em> − 3</span> is
2. So our function must also have that slope. So we need to find the
equation of the linear function with slope 2 and (-2,5) as an
input-output pair.<br />
So: <span class="math display">$$g(x)=2x+b\\5=2(-2)+b\\b=9$$</span> And
so we conclude that our function is <span
class="math inline"><em>g</em>(<em>x</em>) = 2<em>x</em> + 9</span></p>
</div>
<p>Sometimes we also have uses for lines that are perpendicular (that
intersect in a right angle.) There is a relationship between their
slopes as well. If two lines are perpendicular, if the one is rising,
the other must be falling, and vice versa. So, their slopes must have
opposite signs.<br />
Also, two lines will be perpendicular if and only if they are
“switching” their rises and runs. If the one rises three and runs one,
the other must fall one and run three to make the intersection a right
angle. And so:</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><u>Slope of Perpendicular Lines</u><br />
Two lines are perpendicular if, and only if, they have opposite-signed
reciprocal slopes.</p>
</div>
<p>The following example will illustrate how this can be put to use.</p>
<div id="LinearFunctionsGraphsExample6" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 5.37</strong>. Find the formula for the linear
function whose graph passes through the point <span
class="math inline">(3, −1)</span> and is perpendicular to the graph of
<span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = 6<em>x</em> + 11</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>The slope of <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = 6<em>x</em> + 11</span> is
<span class="math inline">6</span>. So our function’s slope must be
<span class="math inline">$-\frac{1}{6}$</span> since that is the
opposite signed reciprocal. Continuing using the given input-output
pair: <span class="math display">$$g(x)=-\frac{1}{6}x+b\\
\\-1=-\frac{1}{6}(3)+b\\ \\b=-\frac{1}{2}$$</span> So our function must
be <span class="math inline">$g(x)=-\frac{1}{6}x-\frac{1}{2}$</span></p>

<h2 id="SystemsofLinearEquations">Systems of Linear Equations</h2>
<p>In this chapter we’ve mostly concerned ourselves with linear
functions. In this last section we’ll take a look at, and find some uses
for, a related but slightly different approach. We’ll begin by defining
some terms.</p>
<h3 id="linear-systems-and-their-solutions">Linear Systems and their
Solutions</h3>
<p>A linear equation is an equation that either explicitly or implicitly
defines a linear function. For example:<span
class="math display"><em>y</em> = 3<em>x</em> + 5</span> is a linear
equation, because if we treat <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em></span> as the output variable it defines
the linear function <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = 3<em>x</em> + 5</span>
(which we know is linear because it is written in slope-intercept
form.)<br />
The equation:<span
class="math display">2<em>x</em> + 3<em>y</em> = 12</span></p>
<p>is also a linear equation, because it implicitly defines a linear
function. We can solve this equation to get:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$y=-\frac{2}{3}x+4$$</span></p>
<p>which we can recognize as linear.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a><br />
Usually, we do not need to actually go through the work of solving for
one of the variables to see that the equation is linear; usually we can
recognize this just by looking at the equation and envisioning what
would happen if we solved for one of the variables.<br />
A <strong>system of linear equations, or linear system</strong> , is
simply any collection of one or more linear equations. For example:</p>
<p><span
class="math display">$$\begin{cases}2x+3y=12\\5x-4y=30\end{cases}$$</span></p>
<p>is a linear system because it consists of these two linear equations.
The bracket that you see on the left side is often used with a linear
system to make it clear that these equations are meant to be considered
together as a linear system, and not just as two individual equations
with no connection to each other. The bracket is not always used in
practice, and isn’t required to have a linear system, but it usually is
there and in this text we will always do so.<br />
A solution to an equation is any pair of values for its variables that
satisfy the equation (that is, any pair of values for its variables that
make the equation true when substituted in). For example, <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em> = 3</span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em> = 2</span>is a solution for the equation
<span class="math inline">2<em>x</em> + 3<em>y</em> = 12</span> because
when we substitute these values in we get:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$2(3) + 3(2) = 12 \\ 6 + 6 = 12 \\ 12 =
12$$</span></p>
<p>which is true. However, this is not a solution to <span
class="math inline">5<em>x</em> − 4<em>y</em> = 30</span> because if we
plug these values into this equation we get:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$5(3)-4(2)=30\\18-8=30\\7=30$$</span></p>
<p>which is obviously not true.</p>
<p>A <strong>simultaneous solution</strong> to a linear system
(sometimes just called a <strong>solution</strong> to the system) is any
pair of values that satisfies all of the equations in the system. For
example, <span class="math inline"><em>x</em> = 3</span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em> = 2</span> is not a simultaneous solution
to the system:</p>
<p><span
class="math display">$$\begin{cases}2x+3y=12\\5x-4y=30\end{cases}$$</span></p>
<p>because we’ve just seen that it does not satisfy both of these
equations (it satisfies the first, but not the second.)</p>
<p>One the other hand, <span class="math inline"><em>x</em> = 6</span>
and <span class="math inline"><em>y</em> = 0</span> is a simultaneous
solution to this system, because both:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$2(6) + 3(0) = 12\\12 + 0 = 12\\12 =
12$$</span></p>
<p>and:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$5(6) - 4(0) = 30\\30 - 0 = 30\\30 =
30$$</span></p>
<p>are true.<br />
We say that we have <strong>solved</strong> a linear system when we have
determined all of its simultaneous solutions.</p>
<h3 id="solving-linear-systems-graphically">Solving Linear Systems
Graphically</h3>
<p>The graphical solution methods we used in Section <a
href="#LinearFunctionsGraphs" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="LinearFunctionsGraphs">5.4</a> can often be used to
solve linear systems. We will present this method by way of an example,
and then give a general description of how to use this method. Read
through this example carefully; you’ll probably recognize a lot in the
method we will use, though setting things up as a linear system will be
new.</p>
<div id="SystemsofLinearEquationsExample1" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 5.38</strong>. Menauhant Publishing Company has a
contract that costs them a straight <span class="math inline">$80</span>
per hour for computer support over the phone. They are considering
switching to a new contract that would require them to pay an annual fee
of <span class="math inline">$3, 000</span> regardless of how much
service they use, but they would then only be charged <span
class="math inline">$50</span> per hour.</p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>If they don’t use much service,
obviously their current plan is better. But if they use a lot of
service, the new plan would be better. If they were to switch to the new
contract, how many hours of service would they have to use to break even
on the switch?<br />
We solved this problem in Section <a href="#LinearFunctionsGraphs"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="LinearFunctionsGraphs">5.4</a>
by setting up a single equation and solving it graphically. Here, we’ll
approach this as a linear system. Cost is a function of hours of service
used with either contract, and if we let <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em></span> be the output (cost) variable and
let <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> be the input (hours of
service) variable, we get the following two equations:</p>
<div class="center">
<p>Current Contract: <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em> = 80<em>x</em></span><br />
New Contract: <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em> = 50<em>x</em> + 3000</span></p>
</div>
<p>To determine the break even between these two options, we need to
figure out what number of hours would give the same cost with both of
these. So, we need to find out the <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> (hours) and <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em></span> (cost) values that would come out
the same with both contracts.<br />
In other words, we need to find a simultaneous solution to the linear
system: <span
class="math display">$$\begin{cases}	y=80x\\y=50x+3000\end{cases}$$</span>
Now each of these equations defines a linear function. The graphs of
those functions are straight lines consisting of all the points that
satisfy their equations. So, the place where the two graphs intersect
would give the values for the variables that satisfy both equations.
Therefore, to find the simultaneous solution to this system, we find the
intersection of the two graphs:</p>
<figure>
<img src="Sections/SystemsofLinearEquationsImages/Figure01.png" />
<figcaption>graph of <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em> = 80<em>x</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em> = 50<em>x</em> + 3000</span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>(For discussion of how to find the appropriate window settings, refer
back to Section <a href="#SolvingEquationsGraphically"
data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="SolvingEquationsGraphically">4.3</a>, Solving Equations
Graphically)<br />
The solution to this system is <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em> = 100</span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em> = 8000</span>. That is, the break even
between these two contracts is <span class="math inline">100</span>
hours of computer support, costing <span
class="math inline">$8000</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>Solving a linear system graphically is basically the same as solving
a linear equation graphically. The main difference is that, when we are
solving a linear system, we start with the two different linear
functions – one coming from each equation. We don’t need the step of
setting up a linear function based on each side of an equation.<br />
The shortcoming of the approach to solving a linear system is that it
requires us to have the equations already in a form that explicitly
defines a linear function. The system in Example <a
href="#SystemsofLinearEquationsExample1" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="SystemsofLinearEquationsExample1">5.38</a> had both
equations already set up in “<span
class="math inline"><em>y</em>=</span>” form. When the equations are set
up to explicitly define a function, you are ready to go. However, for a
linear system whose equations only implicitly define functions,
like:</p>
<p><span
class="math display">$$\begin{cases}2x+3y=12\\5x-4y=30\end{cases}$$</span></p>
<p>we would first have to rewrite each equation in explicit function
form. The next example will illustrate how this would work.</p>
<div id="SystemsofLinearEquationsExample2" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 5.39</strong>. Solve the following linear system
graphically: <span
class="math display">$$\begin{cases}2x+3y=12\\5x-4y=30\end{cases}$$</span></p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>We first must rewrite each equation
in an explicit function form. So we solve each for <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em></span>. <span
class="math display">$$2x+3y=12\\ \\3y=12-2x\\ \\y=\frac{12-2x}{3}\\
\\y=4-\frac{2}{3}x$$</span> and <span class="math display">$$5x-4y=30\\
\\-4y=30-5x\\ \\y=\frac{30-5x}{-4}\\
\\y=-\frac{15}{2}+\frac{5}{4}x$$</span> We now graph these both. Since
we don’t have any insights into the meanings of the equations, we’ll
simply start with the standard window and adjust if needed to find the
intersection. Fortunately, the standard window works:</p>
<figure>
<img src="Sections/SystemsofLinearEquationsImages/Figure02.png" />
<figcaption>Graph to solve system</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>And so we see that the intersection occurs at <span
class="math inline">(6, 0)</span> and so conclude that this system’s
simultaneous solution is <span class="math inline"><em>x</em> = 6</span>
and <span class="math inline"><em>y</em> = 0</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>Most of the time, a given linear system will have one and only one
solution. Each of the equations will define a linear function, those
linear functions have graphs that are straight lines, and straight lines
can only intersect in one place. However, sometimes something does go
wrong, as we will see in the following example.</p>
<div id="SystemsofLinearEquationsExample3" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 5.40</strong>. Solve: <span
class="math display">$$\begin{cases}x-3y=12\\-2x+6y=-4\end{cases}$$</span></p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>Solving the first equation for <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em></span> we get: <span
class="math display">$$x-3y=12\\-3y=12-x\\y=\frac{1}{3}x-4$$</span>
Solving the second equation for <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em></span> we get: <span
class="math display">$$-2x+6y=4\\6y=4+2x\\y=\frac{2}{3}+\frac{1}{3}x$$</span>
Looking at these equations in slope-intercept form it is apparent that
their graphs are parallel lines. So there is no point in looking for an
intersection; the graphs will never intersect.<br />
Therefore, this linear system has no simultaneous solution.</p>
</div>
<p>So, as this example illustrates, not every linear system will have a
solution. Each linear equation has a line as its graph. The lines can
intersect once, giving a unique solution to the system. The lines can be
parallel, giving no solution. And there is a third possibility: the two
lines can turn out to actually be the same. For example, if we were
trying to solve the system:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$\begin{cases} x-3y=12\\-2x+6y=24
\end{cases}$$</span></p>
<p>We’d see after solving both for <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em></span> that both of these equations
actually turn into the same linear function: <span
class="math inline">$y=\frac{1}{3}x-4$</span>. In this case, since the
two equations actually implicitly define the same function, any solution
for the one equation also must be a solution for the other. In this case
there are infinitely many solutions.<br />
In summary, there are three possible results we can run into when
solving a linear system:</p>
<div class="center">

<tr>
<th style="text-align: left;">If the graphs:</th>
<th style="text-align: left;">Then the linear system has:</th>

</div>
<p>We will now summarize this solution method.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><u>Solving a Linear System Graphically</u><br />
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>If the equations are not already in explicit function form, put
both equations in this form by solving them for one of the variables. If
<span class="math inline"><em>y</em></span> is one of the variables,
that’s usually the one we solve for. (It does not actually matter which
variable you solve for, except that it should be the same one in both
equations.)</p></li>
<li><p>If both functions have the same slope but different vertical

have a solution.</p></li>
<li><p>If both functions have the same slope and the same vertical

infinitely many solutions - any of the infinitely many solutions to this
equation will actually be a solution to the system.</p></li>
<li><p>Otherwise, graph both of the functions on your graphing

</div>
<p>Graphical solution always works, but sometimes it is not the most
efficient way to solve a linear system. In the rest of this chapter we
will present two alternative solution methods.</p>
<h3 id="solving-linear-systems-by-substitution">Solving Linear Systems
by Substitution</h3>
<p>Suppose you are confronted with the following linear system:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$\begin{cases} 5x+3y=1\\y=2x-7
\end{cases}$$</span></p>
<p>We could of course solve this graphically. But notice that the second
equation is solved for <span class="math inline"><em>y</em></span>
already. We know from it what <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em></span> must be in terms of <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> for any solution to the system.
So, we could replace the <span class="math inline"><em>y</em></span> in
the top equation with the <span
class="math inline">2<em>x</em> − 7</span> that we know must be equal to
it. If we do this we get:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$5x+3y=1\\5x+3(2x-7)=1$$</span></p>
<p>Now the result of doing this is an equation with only one variable,
which we can solve with ordinary algebra. We simplify the left side:</p>
<p><span
class="math display">5<em>x</em> + 6<em>x</em> − 21 = 11<em>x</em> − 21 = 11</span></p>
<p>and then finish solving to get:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$11x=22\\x=2$$</span></p>
<p>Now this gives us one variable, but we need both to have a complete
solution. But since we know <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>
we can substitute that value into either of the original equations and
then use that to find <span class="math inline"><em>y</em></span>.
Either one works, but the equation already solved for <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em></span> would be easiest:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$y=2x-7\\y=2(2)=7\\y=-3$$</span></p>
<p>We can generalize and summarize what we’ve done here as a new method
for solving linear systems.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><strong><u>Solving a Linear System by Substitution</u></strong><br />

<ol>

<div id="SystemsofLinearEquationsExample4" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 5.41</strong>. I want to fence in a rectangular
garden in my back yard. My feng shui adviser tells me the garden will be
most harmonious if the length is twice the width. I have <span
class="math inline">300</span> feet of fencing. What is the largest
rectangular and harmonious garden I can enclose with this fencing?</p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>If we let <span
class="math inline"><em>W</em></span> represent the width and <span
class="math inline"><em>L</em></span> the length, we know that the total
perimeter is <span class="math inline">2<em>L</em> + 2<em>W</em></span>.
Since that would use the <span class="math inline">300</span> feet of
fencing we must have <span
class="math inline">2<em>L</em> + 2<em>W</em> = 300</span>. Also, the
length is twice the width, so <span
class="math inline"><em>L</em> = 2<em>w</em></span>. So we need to solve
the linear system: <span
class="math display">$$\begin{cases}2L+2W=300\\L=2W\end{cases}$$</span>
The second equation is already solved for <span
class="math inline"><em>L</em></span>, so we use that to substitute into
the top equation and solve: <span
class="math display">$$2L+2W=300\\2(2w)+2W=300\\4W+2W=300\\6W=300\\W=50$$</span>
Now we substitute into the second equation because it is already solved
for <span class="math inline"><em>L</em></span>: <span
class="math display"><em>L</em> = 2<em>W</em></span> <span
class="math display"><em>L</em> = 2(50)</span> <span
class="math display"><em>L</em> = 100</span> So the solution to this
system is <span class="math inline"><em>W</em> = 50</span> and <span

<div id="SystemsofLinearEquationsExample5" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 5.42</strong>. Use substitution to solve the system:
<span class="math display">$$\begin{cases}

</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>We need to start by solving one of
these equations for one of the variables. We can choose to solve either
equation for either variable – the method will work regardless of what
we choose. However, it makes sense to pick the equation and variable
that will be simplest. In the top equation, solving for either variable
will involve dividing by either <span class="math inline">11</span> or
<span class="math inline">3</span>, and we can see that this will mean
fractions will get involved. In the bottom equation solving for <span
class="math inline"><em>T</em></span> would require us to divide through
by <span class="math inline">12</span>, which would make the coefficient
of <span class="math inline"><em>P</em></span> a fraction. But if we
solve for <span class="math inline"><em>P</em></span> we will have to
divide through by <span class="math inline">4</span> and since
everything in that equation is divisible by <span
class="math inline">4</span> that will avoid fractions. So that seems
the cleanest choice. <span class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}
		4P+12T&amp;=12\\
		4P&amp;=12-12T\\
		P&amp;=3-3T
	
\end{aligned}$$</span> Now we plug this substitution into the other
equation: <span class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}
		11T-3P&amp;=1\\
		11T-3(3-3T)&amp;=1
	
\end{aligned}$$</span> And solve the result: <span
class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}
		11T-9+9T&amp;=1\\
		20T-9&amp;=1\\
		20T&amp;=10\\
		T&amp;=\frac{1}{2}
	
\end{aligned}$$</span> To solve for <span
class="math inline"><em>P</em></span> we can plug this into either of
the original equations. Or, we could use the equation <span
class="math inline"><em>P</em> = 3 − 3<em>T</em></span> since that is
solved for <span class="math inline"><em>P</em></span> already. Doing
this: <span class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}
		P&amp;=3-3T\\
		&amp;=3-3(\frac{1}{2})

\end{aligned}$$</span> So the solution to the system of equations is
<span class="math inline">$P=\frac{3}{2}$</span> and <span
class="math inline">$T=\frac{1}{2}$</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>With one last example we will illustrate how things can go wrong. The
problem will not be a problem with substitution itself – just like
graphing, substitution always works - but there can be problems with the
system itself.</p>
<div id="SystemsofLinearEquationsExample6" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 5.43</strong>. Solve by substitution <span
class="math display">$$\begin{cases} x+2z=5\\3x+6z=10
\end{cases}$$</span></p>
</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>As before, we can solve for either
variable in either equation, but it makes sense to go with the cleanest
and simplest choice. In this system, that choice would be to solve for
<span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> in the top equation: <span
class="math display">$$x+2z=5\\x=5-2z$$</span> Now substitute that into
the second equation: <span
class="math display">$$3x+6z=10\\3(5-2z)+6z=10\\15-6z+6z=10\\15=10$$</span>
This of course is a contradiction. This is not a failure of the
substitution method though! When we arrive at a contradiction solving a
regular equation, we simply conclude that the equation has no solutions.
We draw the same conclusion here: the linear system has no solutions.
From our previous discussion of solution by graphing, we furthermore
know that this means that the graphs of the functions implicitly defined
by these two equations must be parallel lines.</p>
</div>
<p>Two solution methods down, there’s still one more to go:</p>
<h3 id="solving-linear-systems-by-elimination">Solving Linear Systems by
Elimination</h3>
<p>Suppose you are presented with the linear system:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$\begin{cases} 5x+2y=1\\3x-2y=7
\end{cases}$$</span></p>
<p>This system can of course be solved by graphing or by substitution,
though either method will require some effort. Here, a third possibility
presents itself. Notice that the <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em></span> terms in the two equations are
just the opposite sign of each other - almost begging us to find a way
to cancel each out against the other.<br />
Now, the second equation says that <span
class="math inline">3<em>x</em> − 2<em>y</em></span> is equal to <span
class="math inline">7</span>. This is a big deal. This means that even
though <span class="math inline">3<em>x</em> + 2<em>y</em></span> and
<span class="math inline">7</span> look quite different, they actually
have the same value. So if I were to add <span
class="math inline">3<em>x</em> + 2<em>y</em></span> to one side of some
other equation, and add <span class="math inline">7</span> to the other
side, this would be OK because I’d be adding equal things to both
sides.<br />
That is precisely what I want to do. We will take the top equation, and
add <span class="math inline">3<em>x</em> + 2<em>y</em></span> to its
left side, and <span class="math inline">7</span> to its right:</p>
<div class="center">
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;"></td>
<td style="text-align: center;">5x</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">+</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">2y</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">=</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">1</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">+</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">(3x</td>

<td style="text-align: center;">0y</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">=</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">8</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<p>So by doing this we’ve created a new equation where one of the
variables (<span class="math inline"><em>y</em></span>) has been
eliminated! The result is easily solved for the remaining variable:</p>
<p><span class="math display">8<em>x</em> = 8</span></p>
<p><span class="math display"><em>x</em> = 1</span></p>
<p>So we have our <span class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>. Now to
get the other variable, we can substitute this value for <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span> into either of the original
equations:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$5x+2y=1\\
	5(1)+2y=1\\
	5+2y=1\\
	2y=-4\\
	y=-2$$</span></p>
<p>So we’ve solved this system: <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em> = 1</span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em> = −2</span>.<br />
Now this was a pretty special case. This approach worked because the
coefficients of <span class="math inline"><em>y</em></span> in the two
equations just happened to be <span class="math inline">±</span> of each
other. That usually won’t happen. But we can force it to happen if we
want to. Suppose we were up against the system:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$\begin{cases} 2p+7q=9\\p+3q=5
\end{cases}$$</span></p>
<p>If we were to multiply both sides of the bottom equation through by
<span class="math inline">−2</span> we’d make the <span
class="math inline"><em>p</em></span> term of that equation <span
class="math inline">−2<em>p</em></span>, perfectly set up to cancel with
the top equation’s <span class="math inline">2<em>p</em></span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$\begin{cases} 2p+7q=9\\-2(p+3q)=-2(5)
\end{cases}$$</span></p>
<p>which makes the system become:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$\begin{cases} 2p+7q=9\\-2p-6q=-10
\end{cases}$$</span></p>
<p>and we could proceed as before, adding the left side of the bottom
equation to the left side of the top, and the right side of the bottom
to the right side of the top to get:</p>
<div class="center">
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;"></td>
<td style="text-align: center;">2p</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">+</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">7q</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">=</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">9</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;">+</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">(-2p</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">-</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">6y)</td>
<td style="text-align: center;"></td>
<td style="text-align: center;">(-10)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;"></td>
<td style="text-align: center;"></td>
<td style="text-align: center;"></td>
<td style="text-align: center;">q</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">=</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">-1</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<p>So the value of <span class="math inline"><em>q</em></span> actually
falls out here beautifully. Plugging it back into either of the original
equations we can solve for <span class="math inline"><em>p</em></span>,
and when you do that you will end up with the solution to this system:
<span class="math inline"><em>p</em> = 8</span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>q</em> = −1</span>.<br />
Now in this system multiplying the bottom equation by <span
class="math inline">−2</span> and eliminating <span
class="math inline"><em>p</em></span> was the simplest solution. But we
could have done it other ways too. For example, if we had multiplied the
top equation by <span class="math inline">3</span> and the bottom one by
<span class="math inline">−7</span> we would have gotten:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$\begin{cases}
		3(2p+7q)=3(9)\\
		-7(p+3q)=-7(5)
	\end{cases}
	\text{    which becomes    }
	\begin{cases}
		6p+21q=27\\
		-7p-21q=-35
	\end{cases}$$</span></p>
<p>which is set up to eliminate <span
class="math inline"><em>q</em></span> which will work out just as well.
The point here is that if we need to, we can multiply through one or
both of the equations in a system to set up one of the variables for
elimination. Let’s generalize this method before looking at another
example:</p>
<div class="definition">
<p><strong><u>Solving a Linear System by Elimination</u></strong><br />
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>If necessary, rearrange the equations so that the corresponding
variables line up.</p></li>
<li><p>If one of the variables has coefficients that are <span
class="math inline">±</span> of each other in the two equations,
continue with the next step. If not, multiply both sides of one equation
or of both equations by something so that one of the variables will have
coefficients that are <span class="math inline">±</span> each
other.</p></li>
<li><p>Add the corresponding sides of the equations. The result should
be a one variable equation. You’ve “eliminated” one of the variables.
(If the result is a contradiction, the system has no solutions. If the
result is an identity, the system has infinitely many
solutions.)</p></li>
<li><p>Solve the resulting one variable equation.</p></li>
<li><p>Substitute the value of the solved for variable into one of the
original equations, and solve for the remaining variable.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="SystemsofLinearEquationsExample7" class="example">
<p><strong>Example 5.44</strong>. Solve by elimination:<span
class="math display">$$\begin{cases} 5p-7q=14\\12p+8q=-16

</div>
<div class="adjustwidth">
<p><span>2em</span><span>2em</span>In this system the variables are

class="math inline"><em>p</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>q</em></span> above <span
class="math inline"><em>q</em></span> so we are ready to go. We can
choose to eliminate either variable; in this case neither one is really
a better choice than the other. If we want to eliminate <span
class="math inline"><em>p</em></span> we could multiply the top equation
through by <span class="math inline">12</span> and the bottom through by
<span class="math inline">−5</span>, or the top by <span
class="math inline">−12</span> and the bottom by <span
class="math inline">5</span>, to make the <span
class="math inline"><em>p</em></span> terms <span
class="math inline">±60<em>p</em></span>. Or we could eliminate <span
class="math inline"><em>q</em></span> by multiplying the top by <span

class="math inline">7</span> to make the <span

For no particular reason, we’ll take the path that eliminates <span

		7(12p+8q)=7(-16)

	\text{    which becomes    }
	\begin{cases}
		40p-56q=112\\
		84p+56q=-112
	\end{cases}$$</span></p>
<p>and now we add the corresponding sides of the system to get:</p>
<div class="center">

</div>
<p>which we now solve to conclude that: <span
class="math display"><em>p</em> = 0</span> Substituting this into either
equation (for no particular reason we’ll choose the top one):</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}

	5(0)-7q&amp;=14\\
	-7q&amp;=14\\

<p>So the system’s solution is <span
class="math inline"><em>p</em> = 0</span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>q</em> = −2</span>.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="strategies-for-solving-linear-systems">Strategies for Solving
Linear Systems</h3>
<p>So we now have three methods to solve linear systems. All three
methods always work - no matter which method you choose to use, if the
system has a solution you will find it, and if there is no solution or
are infinitely many solutions each system has a way of telling you that
as well. So, in the face of a given linear system, how do you choose
which method to use?<br />
Even though all three methods will work on any system, it is often the
case that one of them will be a lot less work than the others. For
example, the system: is set up beautifully for a graphical solution
(just letting <span class="math inline"><em>w</em></span> become the Y
and <span class="math inline"><em>z</em></span> the X in your graphing
calculator.<br />
This system is also set up nicely for substitution, since both equations
are already solved for <span class="math inline"><em>w</em></span>,
making it easy to replace the <span
class="math inline"><em>w</em></span> in either equation to get the
equation</p>
<p><span
class="math display">3<em>z</em> − 1 = −5<em>z</em> + 2</span></p>
<p>Actually elimination would also work pretty nicely with this system
(just multiply both sides of either equation through by <span
class="math inline">−1</span>), though given how nicely this is set up
for the other methods elimination probably would not be the preferred
way to go.<br />
For a different example, consider this system:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$\begin{cases}5p-4q=3\\p=q+1
\end{cases}$$</span></p>
<p>Now with this system, graphing would work, but it would require
solving the top equation for <span class="math inline"><em>p</em></span>
to start. That’s not too difficult, but it would take a bit of algebra
effort, and would introduce fractions. Not too bad, but not nearly as
simple as noticing that the second equation is already solved for <span
class="math inline"><em>p</em></span> in terms of <span
class="math inline"><em>q</em></span>. Given that, it would be simple to
use this to substitute into the top equation to get <span
class="math inline">5(<em>q</em> + 1) − 4<em>q</em> = 3</span> which is
not a hard equation to solve.<br />
Elimination on the other hand would take more doing. We would first have
to rearrange the bottom equation so that the variables would line up,
getting:</p>
<p><span class="math display">$$\begin{cases}5p-4q=3\\p-q=1
\end{cases}$$</span></p>
<p>and then proceeding. Now this actually is a pretty straightforward
elimination problem, but the effort of rearranging and then doing the
elimination seems to me to be much greater than the effort required to
do substitution right from the start.<br />
Now, which method would be the best bet with this system?</p>
<p><span
class="math display">$$\begin{cases}3x-11y=28\\2x-9y=22\end{cases}$$</span></p>
<p>For this graphing would require solving both equations for one of the
variables, requiring a fair amount of algebra and a fair amount of
fractions. Not the end of the world, but maybe not too desirable if we
can avoid it.<br />
Substitution would probably not go well. Solving either equation for one
of the variables would involve some messiness. The best bet would be to
solve the second equation for <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>, which would give <span
class="math inline">$x=\frac{9}{2}y+11$</span> which would then be
substituted into the top equation to get <span
class="math inline">$3(\frac{9}{2}y+11)-11=28$</span>. Again not the end
of the world, but not too much fun, either.<br />
On the other hand, this system is beautifully set up for elimination.
Multiplying the top through by <span class="math inline">2</span> and
the bottom by <span class="math inline">−3</span> would set this up for
a nice, clean, elimination of the <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>. Now in each of these examples, it
really doesn’t matter which method you use. Again, any method will work
on any system, so you never have to worry that you’ll make the “wrong
choice” and then be unable to solve the system because of your choice.
But when confronted with a new system to solve it is worth spending a
moment or two to think through how each method would play out. Investing
a moment or two to strategize your solution method can save you
unnecessary effort.<br />
In the exercises for this section, you will find many problems where you
are asked to solve a linear system by a specific method. It is important
that you know how to use all three methods so that you have all three at
your disposal, and also because each of the three methods can be
generalized to other uses in mathematics. (For example, substitution can
be used even if the equations in a system are non-linear, but
elimination does not work so well in that case; while elimination adapts
readily to linear systems with more than two variables while
substitution does not do so nearly as well and graphing is hopeless!)
For this reason, if a specific method is called for, you must use that
method.<br />
In other problems, though, you have your choice. In those cases, choose
wisely! Making a good choice of method can save you an awful lot of
needless effort.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>Just as in some countries the standard is to drive on
the left, there actually are some circumstances in which a different
order of operations is used. Two examples are Polish notation, developed
in the early 1900’s by the Polish logician Jan Lukasiewicz, and Reverse
Polish notation, a variation of regular Polish notation. These are used
in certain very special technical circumstances. But you are very
unlikely to ever run into those circumstances, though, and if you ever
do, you’ll know!<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"

<li id="fn3"><p>There was no moment of invention, and no single inventor
of algebra, so we can’t really pinpoint “when algebra was invented”. The
methods we now call “algebra” developed over the course of more than
1000 years. But all of that happened long after the Babylonians. Most
people consider the start of development of our familiar
variables-and-equations algebra to the work of the Persian mathematician
Muhammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī, who lived from around 780-850 CE. The
word “algebra” comes from one of the words in the Arabic title of one of
his books “Al-Kitāb al-mukhtaṣ ar fī ḥ isāb al-jabr wa-l-muqābala”.<a
href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>“Cartesian” is derived from the name “Descartes”. The
“Des” is left off for reasons having to do with the Latin form of his
name.<a href="#fnref4" class="footnote-back"

<li id="fn5"><p>Actually this is not quite correct. The force of gravity
grows stronger the closer you get to the center of the earth, and so as
the rock falls the rate at which its speed accelerates actually does
change very slightly. However, this change in acceleration is extremely
slight and so it is generally ignored. This means a linear function is
not perfectly accurate, but is good enough for almost any reasonable
purpose.<a href="#fnref5" class="footnote-back"

<li id="fn6"><p>A face cord is a unit of volume commonly used for
firewood; one face cord is a stacked wood pile measuring 4 feet high, 8
feet wide, and 16 inches in depth.<a href="#fnref6"
class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn7"><p>Actually we could just as well have solved for <span
class="math inline"><em>x</em></span>. It’s more common for <span
class="math inline"><em>y</em></span> to be the output variable, but as
we’ve seen before that’s not a requirement.<a href="#fnref7"
